<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The plan of this book has special reference to the
Mother when comes the woful plaint, "I don't know
what to do! Mama, what can I do now?"</p>

<p>Is she busy in the kitchen? She has right there
material for the little one's happy employment. Is she
mending the stockings? She can give him needle and
thread and, with the aid of this book, a word of suggestion.
In spare moments both mother and children
can together prepare papers, cards, etc., for future
occasions.</p>

<p>It will be found upon examination that although
some of the articles described herein require material
peculiar to certain localities, very many more may be
made of things to be found in every home, whether
the city flat or the remote country homestead. Usually
a choice is possible. One may use the cardboard,
paper, etc., saved from the scrap-basket or may send
to supply houses for material partially prepared. It
is an undoubted advantage for the child to be trained
to see the possibilities in the raw material lying at
hand. It stimulates his inventive imagination and
makes for efficiency and the power to cope with
emergencies.</p>

<p>The child accustomed to looking upon odds and
ends of wire, paper, weeds, seeds, and grasses as
hiding delightful secrets which he may learn to unravel
and utilize, may be readily trained to regard
all Nature as a vast storehouse open to his investigation,
and a continual source of inspiration.</p>

<p>The child, habituated to mastering the raw material
of his immediate environment, will not be discomfited
if thrown upon an unknown shore, whether
arctic or tropical. He will recognize everywhere
about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
 him possibilities for shelter, food, clothing, and
transportation and will know how to use them.</p>

<p>But the child must be trained to perceive the
beautiful and the ideal as well as the useful. Into
each article here described, even the simplest, enter
the elements of beauty, proportion, harmony of line
and color, and good, true workmanship, leading surely,
even if unconsciously, to an appreciation of the best
wherever found.</p>

<p>In making an article as a gift for child or adult,
thought for others is cultivated and the frequently
needed help of older brother or sister encourages the
spirit of goodwill and kindliness.</p>

<p>The festival occasions are especially valuable in
developing the sense of interdependence and large-mindedness.</p>

<p>Among a people proverbially wasteful it is certainly
the part of wisdom to train the child to economy
for the sake of future service. The contents of the
city garbage barrel are found by business men to be
worth sorting and classifying and everything proves
to be of some use. Why should not the child be
taught, before throwing away the discarded picture
book, to ask if there is not a use for it still? A nation
so trained will preserve its forests and save its
Niagaras. It will see things material and things
spiritual in their true relations.</p>

<p>We would suggest that a little cupboard be placed
within easy reach of the child. Here he may keep
his own scissors, paste, pencil and papers, ready
for use when the propitious moment of inspiration
seizes him.</p>

<p>Too much exactness must not be required of the
very young child, but as fast as he is able to do good
work insist upon the best of which <i>he</i> is capable.
Train <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
him always to try to surpass himself. Above
all, let him be happy in the doing.</p>

<p>The ideas offered in this volume have been garnered
from various sources. Practical experience in
the home has suggested many, and actual daily work
in the kindergarten has given rise to others. A few,
such as the thimble biscuit party and croquet with
peas, are among the recollections of happy childhood.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to acknowledge the obligation to
Miss Fanny Chapin, of Chicago, a kindergartner of
long experience, for the comradeship of thought which
made the book possible. Miss Chapin also contributed
the directions for making feather flowers,
many of the holiday suggestions, and other items scattered
through the book.</p>

<p>The conversion of corks into a set of furniture
was learned from a German playmate twenty-five
years ago. Imagine the interest with which we discovered
a set, almost identical, at the German exhibit
of the recent International Kindergarten Union.</p>

<p>The candlesticks of tin or cardboard, brightened
with colored tissue-paper, varied to suit particular
occasions, is a regular feature of the festival dinners
at the Gertrude House, Chicago.</p>

<p>To one and all to whom, consciously or unconsciously,
we may be indebted for any suggestions, we
express our thanks.</p>

<p>A perusal of this little volume will show that it is
far from exhaustive of the topics treated. It is largely
a book of suggestion. If it stimulates the child to
new investigations and experiments along similar
lines; if it reinforces the spirit of brotherly kindness
in the home; or if it helps to solve any of the
problems of the mother, the hopes of the authors will
be accomplished.</p>

<br />

THE SECRETS OF THE MARKET BASKET</h2>


<p>The busy but thoughtful mother will find in the
contents of the market basket many possibilities for
happily employing the creative instinct of her child.
We give a few suggestions which demand activity of
both mind and body.</p>


<h3>STRAWBERRY-BOXES</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Seed-Markers</b> (<i>No tools needed but the fingers</i>)</p>

<p>Remove the rim of wood which binds the box
into shape, that the little tacks may not injure the
child. Then let him tear the sides and bottom into
little slats which can be used as seed-markers. Older
children can write upon them the names of seeds, and
when planted put one of these slats into the ground
to indicate where the seeds may be expected to
come up.</p>

<p>The little child enjoys the sense of power that he
feels simply in being able to tear these boxes apart,
but let there be a thought back of the action if it
seem to degenerate into pure destructiveness.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy-Fences</b> (<i>Employing fingers only</i>)</p>

<p>Split the boxes with the fingers into pieces wide
or narrow, as desired, and the slats thus made can be
turned into fences for the play farm in the sand-box,
or for borders for small flower beds. (1) Stick them
into <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the sand or earth side by side, to suggest a plain
board fence; or (2) Put very narrow ones at short
intervals apart to suggest a picket fence.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy-Fences</b> (<i>Scissors</i>, <i>tacks</i>)</p>

<p>If old enough to use scissors, let the child cut the
boxes apart with long scissors and use for fences as
before. (1) Side by side for board fence. (2) Cut
into very narrow strips for picket fence. Use the rim
of the basket for the rail to unite the pickets, fastening
them with the tiny tacks which are already in it.
Pickets might be one inch apart. Cutting the tops of
the pickets into points will complete the resemblance to
a real fence. Put the rails about one-half inch from
top.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Boxes for tacks, seeds, etc.</b> (<i>Scissors</i>, <i>paste</i>, <i>paste-sticks</i>,
<i>ribbon, 8&frac12; inches long, 1&frac12; inches wide</i>,
<i>wall-paper</i>, <i>pan with water</i>)</p>

<p>Take two pieces of a box, each measuring 2 × 5
inches. Soak in water till soft. Place one directly
across the middle of the other, and bend the four
projecting ends up perpendicularly into box form.
(1) Hold the sides in place by winding the ribbon
around the four sides, till they meet, and paste the one
overlapping end over the other. (2) Cut a piece of
wall-paper (obtainable often from a wall-hanger's
shop) into a strip 1&frac12; × 8&frac12; inches and wind around,
pasting one end over the other. If the child is inexperienced
the paper may be cut of exactly the height
of box. If skillful in so doing, let him cut the strip
&frac12; inch wider and turn down over the top to give a
little finish. This gives practice in neatness and skill.</p>

<p>Let the child observe how a Swedish matchbox
is made&mdash;the wood held together by strips of thin but
tough <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
paper&mdash;and then carry his thought to the far-distant
land which sends us the magic wands that
give us light with safety. And all carried in a tiny
box made of wood and paper. Decalcomanias might
be used for decoration of the plain wooden box.</p>

<p>Let the child experiment in making boxes of
different shapes and sizes for his collections of seeds,
stones, etc. This cultivates his ingenuity and practical
imagination.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Picture Frames</b> (<i>Scissors</i>, <i>thumb-tacks</i>, <i>gold paint</i>,
<i>water-colors</i>, <i>glue</i>)</p>

<p>Cut three slats, each 1 × 8 inches, to make triangular
frame. Unite with thumb-tacks, one at each of the
three corners. To place them exactly the right way
may take a little experimenting, which helps develop
the child's sense of proportion and arrangement.
When joined, cut off the projecting parts at the top
to give pointed effect. Good for pictures of Indians,
as wigwam is suggested. Decorate by gilding or
painting. Can be painted with Ivory paints or water-colors.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Chicken-Coops</b> (<i>Scissors</i>, <i>glue</i>)</p>

<p>Remove the rim, bottom (in one piece) and two
adjoining sides of a berry box. This leaves two sides
remaining which are already bent into correct form
for coop. Cut the bottom of the box in half from
corner to corner. This gives the triangular back of
the coop which must be glued on. The slats must
now be made and put into place. Cut three slats each
&#8540; inches wide. (1) In each of the two front edges
of the coop cut three horizontal slits &#8540; inches deep;
slip the slats into these and cut off the projecting ends.
The slats at the top will necessarily be shorter than
those <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
at the bottom. (2) Or an older child can cut in
each of the two edges 3 notches &#8540; inches deep and
&#8540; inches high and glue the slats into these, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i_015" name="i_015"></a>
<img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt="i_015" />

<p class="caption">Chicken-Coop.</p>

</div>




<p class="hang2"><b>Paste-Sticks</b> (<i>Boxes</i>, <i>scissors</i>)</p>

<p>Cut sides of boxes into slender pieces which can be
put aside and used for paste-sticks when pasting is
the order of the day. They will prove to be better
than brushes.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Wagon</b> (<i>Thumb-tacks</i>, <i>button-molds</i>, <i>skewers</i>, <i>glue</i>,
<i>small, slender nails</i>)</p>

<p class="pb">Take two boxes. Remove rims. Bend down one
side of each of the boxes so that it is horizontal. Lap
one of these exactly over the other and join with
thumb-tacks. This makes the body of coal wagon.
For wheels use (1) large wooden button-molds or (2)
the cardboard circles round which ribbons come.
Make axles of skewers. Glue axle to bottom of wagon,
slip on the wheels and insert small, slender nail
to keep wheel from coming off. If skewers are not
at hand whittle a slender piece from a stick of kindling
wood, whittling the ends until slender enough for the
wheels to slip on. Paint spokes on the wheels and
paint the wagon, using any paint at hand.</p>

inch over on itself from the top, for hem. Gather or
pleat the silk near the top with silk of same color and
glue to the inner side of the basket near the top, leaving
a little projecting edge for ruffle. Leave the
lower ends free. The silk should be two inches
wider than the depth of the basket and one and one-third
times as long as the four sides of the basket.
Now take a square of cardboard the size of the bottom
of the basket and cover it smoothly with a square
of silk, folding the silk neatly over the sides and catching
it across so as to be smooth on the right side. Put
this silk square down in the bottom of the basket and
it will hold the sides of the lining firm. A basket
may be lined with paper in the same way, using glue
to hold it in place. As paper can not very well be
gathered, the top may be glued down smoothly or the
paper may be pleated.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Hanging-Basket</b> (<i>Lead from tea-box</i>, <i>ribbon or wire</i>,
<i>earth</i>, <i>seeds</i>)</p>

<p>Line a berry box with the lead, fill with good earth
and plant vines or flower-seeds. Suspend by ribbon
or wire.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Dolls' Furniture</b> (<i>Spools</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>glue</i>)</p>

<p>1. Table.&mdash;Make a table by cutting a slat from a
basket into an oblong 2 × 3 inches and glue to spool
for dining-table.</p>

<p>2. Bed.&mdash;Soak a few moments and when flexible
cut an oblong 2 × 6 inches and bend one end up 1&frac12;
inches <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to form head of bed. Bend the other end up
&frac12; inch to form the foot. Glue two spools to the bottom
of this for legs, one at each end.</p>

<p>3. Chair.&mdash;Make chairs for the same set by cutting
a piece of the box to measure 1 × 2 inches. Bend
across the middle so that a right angle is formed and
glue one side to a spool. The other half forms the
back of the chair. Such furniture may be colored
with dyes or Ivory paints.</p>


<h3>PEAS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Shelling Peas</b> (<i>Tin pans</i>)</p>

<p>Let the child help Mother to shell the peas for
dinner. Children enjoy work of this kind when coöperating
with the mother or father. They like to do
what Mother is doing when she is doing it too. This
will be an excellent time to tell Hans Andersen's story
of the "Five Peas that Dwelt in a Pod". As a reward
let the child plant a few peas in a box or out-of-doors.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Pea-Pod Boat</b> (<i>Pan of water</i>, <i>peapods</i>)</p>

<p>Give a small child a dish-pan filled with water
and a peapod for a boat, with peas for passengers
and he will entertain himself for a long time. Let the
frequency with which he is allowed this privilege depend
upon his care in keeping himself and his surroundings
dry, thus leading to neatness and self-control.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Pea Furniture</b> (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">chapter on kindergarten occupations</a>)</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Numeral <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Frame or Abacus</b> (<i>Hair-wire</i>, <i>cardboard
stationery box</i>)</p>

<p>Get ten slender pieces of wire about six inches long.
Put one pea on the first, two on the second, three on
the third, etc., until you reach the last, on which place
ten. Take an empty stationery box, and cut away the
bottom leaving the four sides intact as a frame. Into
this frame insert the ten wires, the one with one pea
at the top, then No. 2, 3, etc. The child can then practice
counting the different combinations up to ten.</p>

<p>Instead of peas such a series of units could be
made by stringing cranberries or rose-haws on a
waxed thread.</p>


<h3>POTATOES AND SQUASH</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Potato Horse</b> (<i>Three potatoes</i>, <i>slender sticks or
tooth-picks</i>, <i>raveled string or coarse black thread</i>)</p>

<p>Take large potato for body of horse, a smaller one
for the neck, and another for the head. Join them
with sticks broken to convenient length. Four other
sticks make the legs, two little ones the ears and the
string or thread the flowing tail. The tail can be attached
to a tack or pin and inserted.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Squash or Sweet Potato Animals</b> (<i>Crooked-neck
squash or sweet potato for each animal</i>, <i>slender
sticks</i>)</p>

<p>Insert sticks for legs into crooked-neck squashes
and convert into animals of various kinds, the kind
depending upon the size of the neck and general shape.
Sweet potatoes by their queer shapes will often suggest
animals: pigs, dogs, etc., or ducks, swans, ostriches,
and birds. Use tacks or shoe buttons for eyes. Dolls
can be made also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>


<h3>CORN HUSKS&mdash;GREEN</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Mat</b> (<i>Husks</i>, <i>needle</i>, <i>thread</i>)</p>

<p>Take four smooth husks and press between blotting
paper for 24 hours. Then tear into &frac14; inch
strips. Lay eight of these on the table. Take eight
more and weave these under and over the first eight,
making mat for doll-house. Put again between blotters.
The next day, slide the strips together till they
lie smooth and even, and close together. Fasten by
sewing the outside strips lightly to the interlacing
ones. Cut the extending parts off about one inch from
outside strips.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Feathers</b> (<i>Husks</i>, <i>scissors</i>)</p>

<p>Take a dozen leaves of the husks; cut slits slant-wise
down the edges about &frac14; inch apart. Let dry 24
hours. Then use as feathers for Indian head dress,
using design on copper cent as model.</p>


<h3>CORN-COBS&mdash;DRY</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Corn-Crib</b> (<i>Cobs</i>, <i>hammer</i>, <i>nails</i>, <i>cover of starch-box</i>)</p>

<p>To a small piece of thin wood like the cover of a
starch-box nail four short cobs of equal length for
legs (half an inch or an inch long). Around the four
sides, on top, nail a row of slender cobs for the walls
of the corn crib. Make roof of cobs or lay a piece of
cardboard across. Nail from below, through the
board. It will require a little thought to determine
just where the nail must go in order to run through
the board and into the cob above, but tell the child
that he is a little carpenter and must make careful
measurements. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Ask if he can think why the crib is
raised thus from the ground. (To preserve the corn
from the rats and mice.)</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy-Raft</b> (<i>Cobs</i>, <i>rim of berry-box</i>, <i>tacks</i>)</p>

<p>Lay six or more cobs of equal length side by
side upon the table. Take a piece of binding-rim of
a berry-box as long as the row of cobs is wide. Lay
it across the row near one end and nail it fast to each
cob. Nail a similar piece across the other end. This
will make a serviceable toy-raft. Stick in a skewer
for a mast and make a sail-boat. Paste on the mast a
triangular piece of paper or muslin for a sail.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Zig-Zag Fence</b> (<i>Cobs only</i>)</p>

<p>Lay down half a dozen cobs in zigzag fashion,
with their ends not quite as far apart as the length of
the cobs. Then across every two ends lay another cob,
and so build up the fence.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Post-Fence</b> (<i>Cobs</i>, <i>tacks</i>, <i>skewers</i>, <i>slats</i>)</p>

<p>Lay several cobs in a row a few inches apart as
posts. Unite them by laying across them two rows
of skewers or kindergarten slats. Join with tiny tacks.
Use in the sand-table or dolls' farm.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>House</b> (<i>Cobs</i>, <i>nails</i>)</p>

<p>(1) Take two cobs and place them opposite to
each other. Place two others across the ends of the
first two, at right angles to them. Then two more
directly over the first two and so on, building up
alternately for log cabin. This is the first simple
building experiment of the little child. Two such
cabins put together will make a two-roomed house.
Thus made it will be crude with wide interstices between
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
logs, but this forms no objection to the
child.</p>

<p>(2) When he does manifest the desire for something
better made&mdash;a house which will not admit the
rain and snow&mdash;a more solid house can be made thus:
Place three cobs end to end to form three sides of a
square. Directly upon these lay three more, and nail
firmly to those beneath at the ends, with slender nails.
Build up in this way as high as desirable. One side
has, however, been left open. Now put in the fourth
wall but leave place for the doorway. Do this by
making the lower part of the wall of cobs so short that
they do not even go half way across the opening.
Take two such short cobs and nail each to the side of
the house. A little space will be left between them,
say of two inches. Take two more of same length and
place on top of the first two and nail in place. The
third cob may be long enough to extend straight
across the little house making the top of the doorway.
Put another and another on top until the last row is
reached. Roof with similar logs or with cardboard.
The child can be trained a little in forethought when
led to save anything like corncobs for possible use in
the future.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Furniture</b> (<i>4 short cobs</i>, <i>4 long slender ones</i>, <i>tacks</i>,
<i>cheesecloth</i>, <i>fine cord</i>, <i>cotton batting</i>)</p>

<p>Take four short cobs for sturdy legs. Nail to
these four slender cobs for bed-frame. In the inner
part of the long sides of the bed hammer small tacks
about &frac34; inches apart. Then string cord from one
tack across to the opposite one and so on, to make
springs. Make mattress of cheesecloth stuffed with
cotton. Other furniture can easily be made in similar
manner.</p>

<p>In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
 this work, as with other suggestions here given,
older children will need to help younger ones and thus
the spirit of helpfulness and sympathy is exercised.</p>


<h3>CORN KERNELS&mdash;DRY</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Portieres</b> (<i>Kernels of corn</i>, <i>straws</i>, <i>needle</i>, <i>coarse
thread</i>, <i>pan</i>)</p>

<p>Soak corn in pan of water over night or till soft.
Get inch-long pieces of straw at kindergarten supply
store, or, if obtainable in the country, get the straws
entire and let the children cut them into inch pieces.
In all this work it is desirable to let the child do as
much as possible himself. Later, when familiar with
materials and simple processes, let him use the prepared
bought material.</p>

<p>Now, let him string the corn and straws alternately.
He can then vary by stringing first one kernel
and one straw; then two kernels and one straw; then
three, etc. This gives practice in counting, and exercises
also his sense of taste and proportion and his
invention. A pretty effect can be secured by using
kernels of the two colors, red and yellow.</p>

<p>Suspend a number of such strings in the doorway;
they may be all of the same length or may be
very short in the middle of the doorway and gradually
get longer as the jamb is approached.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Designing</b> (<i>Red and yellow kernels</i>)</p>

<p>On a rainy day let the child employ his inventive
skill in making designs of the red and yellow kernels
on a flat table. He can lay them in squares, oblongs,
crosses, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<h3>POP-CORN</h3>

<p>There are few American children who need to
be told how to pop corn; they see it done before they
are able to do it themselves. But this fascinating occupation
is not known to many children outside of the
United States. Perhaps it is well that our children
should appreciate their privilege in this respect.</p>

<p>If a popper is unobtainable, corn can be quickly
and deliciously popped by putting a tablespoonful of
butter in a deep kettle and when it is hot dropping in a
cupful of popcorn. Shake or rather stir to keep from
burning and in a short time the kettle will be full of
the white popping fairy-like kernels. Salt or sugar
can be sprinkled in as desired.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Balls</b> (<i>Corn</i>, <i>popper</i>, <i>sugar</i>, <i>molasses or water</i>)</p>

<p>Make a thin syrup by boiling together equal
quantities of sugar and water or two cupfuls sugar,
one of molasses or syrup, one teaspoonful vinegar, and
butter size of an egg. Cook until it hardens when
dropped in water, then pour it over 8 quarts of popped
corn as quickly as possible and mold into balls, making
about twenty. If made with strawberry syrup the
color will be a beautiful red.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Festoons</b> (<i>Popped corn</i>, <i>needle</i>, <i>coarse thread</i>)</p>

<p>Thread the kernels to adorn walls or picture
frames or Christmas tree.</p>


<h3>NUTS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Boat</b> (<i>Walnut shell</i>, <i>pan of water</i>, <i>toothpicks</i>, <i>candle-wax</i>)</p>

<p>When busy with her baking the mother can give
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
three-year-old in his high chair a half walnut
shell for a boat. An older child can elaborate into a
sail-boat by cutting a triangular piece of paper for
a sail, glueing it to a toothpick for mast, and then
melting a drop of wax from a candle and inserting
the mast while the wax is still warm. A burnt match
can be shaped into a mast also.</p>

<p>Such a fleet of tiny vessels would prettily set a
table for a farewell dinner to one going abroad.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Surprise Walnuts</b> (<i>English walnuts</i>, <i>baby-ribbon</i>,
<i>tiny dolls or animals</i>, <i>glue</i>)</p>

<p>Open a number of walnuts carefully so as not to
break the shell. Remove the meats and fasten the two
sides together with a tiny strip of ribbon, which serves
as a hinge, glueing the ends of the ribbon to the inside
of the half shells. Ribbon need be only an inch
long or less. Put a tiny doll or a wee china rabbit or
kitten inside the shell and tie around with ribbon.
Little china animals come in sets of five or six.</p>

<p>A little verse of greeting or a conundrum can be
written and put inside if the toys are not available.</p>

<p>A group of little children could be kept busy and
happy for an afternoon making some of these little
souvenirs for a home dinner or for a fair.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Nut-Animals</b> (<i>Peanuts</i>, <i>toothpicks</i>)</p>

<p>The imagination of most children will quickly
perceive resemblances to all kinds of creatures in
the queer shapes of peanuts. Take such a peanut
and stick into it four bits of toothpicks for legs and
two tiny ones for ears. If the toothpicks are not
sharp or strong enough to penetrate of themselves,
make incisions with a sharp pin.</p>

<p>One common shape suggests a cat, seated. Two
vertical <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
pieces would make the front legs and two
horizontal pieces the back legs resting on the ground.
Eyes and mouth can be inked in. Another shape
hints at an owl with sharp, curved beak. Another
will make a hen. Once started on this line of experiment,
the child will discover likenesses for himself.
These creatures can be used in the toy farm.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Peanut party</b> (<i>See <a href="#Page_103">page 103</a></i> )</p>


<h3>APPLES</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Candlestick</b> (<i>Apple</i>, <i>candle</i>)</p>

<p>Cut in the top of a rosy apple a hole of right
size to hold a candle. Appropriate for Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>A carrot can also be used thus, but a part must
be cut away at the bottom so as to secure a firm
base.</p>


<h3>ORANGES</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Baskets</b> (<i>Orange</i>, <i>smaller fruits</i>)</p>

<p>Cut an orange horizontally partly through the
middle from each side so as to leave a part in the
centre which can be cut into a handle. Hollow out
the interior and put raisins, small nuts, etc., in it.</p>


<h3>RED PEPPERS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Lantern</b> (<i>Large red pepper</i>, <i>knife</i>)</p>

<p>Hollow out a large red pepper and cut into it
eyes, nose and mouth, making a miniature Jack-o'-lantern.
This makes a pretty table decoration.</p>

<p>Let <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the child help as much as possible by making
these little table decorations. If you want boy and
girl to love home, give them a share in making it interesting
and attractive. Do not discourage them if
their efforts are a little crude at times. It is the
spirit of good-will which makes the blessed home.</p>


<h3>EGG-SHELLS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Garden</b> (<i>Shell</i>, <i>earth</i>, <i>birdseed</i>)</p>

<p>Cut an egg-shell in half horizontally, with a sharp
pair of scissors, and three days before Easter put into
it a little earth, place in this a little canary seed, or
a single pea or bean, and a little plant will delight the
child.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Doll's Cradle</b> (<i>Shell</i>, <i>ribbon half an inch wide</i>, <i>paste</i>,
<i>cardboard</i>)</p>

<p>Take a smooth white egg and blow it. To do
this make a tiny pin-hole in each end, and by blowing
into one end steadily the contents can be emptied out
of the other. Draw lines lengthwise and crosswise
around the shell, dividing it into four equal parts.
Then, following the line, cut away the upper quarter
toward the small end. This leaves a cradle with a
small canopy. Paste the ribbon neatly around for a
binding round the edge. Rockers can be made by
cutting curved pieces &frac14; inch wide out of thick cardboard,
although such a cradle will rock without rockers.</p>

<p>Mattress for above. (<i>Thin white ribbon</i>, <i>milkweed
down</i>, <i>needle</i>, <i>sewing silk</i>)</p>

<p>Cut and sew the ribbon into a tiny mattress for
this fairy cradle, and stuff with milkweed down. If
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
ribbon is just the width of the cradle the edges
of the mattress can be neatly overcast. A tiny doll
may then be placed within the cradle.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Boat</b> (<i>Goose-egg</i>, <i>leatherette paper</i>, <i>kindergarten
slats</i>)</p>

<p>Blow the egg as described above. Cut in half
lengthwise. Cut the paper into strips &frac12; inch wide.
In each side of the shell cut an indentation &#8540; inches
deep and &#8540; inches wide for oarlocks. Then bind
neatly with the paper strips. Cut the slats (or a
piece of berry box will do) into tiny oars and paste
a seat across, which is also cut out of a slat.</p>

<p>Careful handling is required for these dainty
toys, and if the child seems to get nervous let her do
only a little at a time; but much neatness and skill
is exercised in the making, and it is good practice for
older children. The wise mother soon learns to detect
the difference between the poor work which is
the result of pure nervousness and that which is the
consequence of carelessness. The latter should never
be permitted to stand. See to it that what the child
does is up to his best capacity.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Humpty-Dumpty Eggs</b> (<i>Shell</i>, <i>shot</i>, <i>water-color
paints</i>, <i>a bit of cotton-batting</i>, <i>and a bit of tough
paper</i>)</p>

<p>Take a shell and empty of contents as described
above. Enlarge the hole at one end sufficiently to
drop in a dozen tiny shot obtainable at hardware
store. Paste over the opening the bit of paper, and
on that a little cotton to simulate hair. Paint upon
the surface eyes, nose, and mouth. A comical little
toy which always regains its balance, however placed,
is the result. In playing with this the child unconsciously
imbibes <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
a few ideas about equilibrium, equipoise,
etc. Tell him you want him to be a man that,
however placed, will always be able to get upon his
feet again.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Foot-ball</b>, or rather it might be called Breath-ball
(<i>Egg-shell</i>, <i>water-color paints</i>)</p>

<p>Take an empty shell and paint to resemble a football
or in some college or High School colors. See
<a href="#Page_99">page 99</a> for directions for game.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Lamp</b> (See under Doll-Houses)</p>


<h3>PRUNES AND RAISINS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Turtle</b> (<i>Raisin and five cloves</i>)</p>

<p>Take a plump raisin and stick into it five cloves
for head and legs.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Man</b> (<i>Raisins or prunes</i>, <i>toothpicks</i>)</p>

<p>Make a man by running a toothpick through
three raisins for a body. Into the top one stick two
other toothpicks, with two raisins each for arms and
two other toothpicks with raisins make the legs. Each
leg has a projecting raisin for a foot and another
large raisin makes the head. These are fun-makers
for a children's party, one at each plate.</p>


<h3>SEEDS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Stringing</b> (<i>Squash seeds&mdash;dried</i>, <i>strong thread</i>, <i>needle</i>)</p>

<p>Little children can be happily occupied making
chains <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of squash, pumpkin, and water-melon seeds
that have been saved and made soft by soaking
awhile in water. The black seeds of the water-melon
alternate prettily with the white seeds of the other
gourds. Variety can be introduced by stringing several
of one color and then several of another, counting
by twos, threes, etc. This gives exercise in counting,
in pleasing grouping of colors, and so exercises both
the invention and the taste of the very little child.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Designing</b> (<i>Black seeds</i>, <i>white seeds</i>)</p>

<p>Let the child make designs of the seeds upon
the table. Place a black one for a centre and a white
one on each side. Repeat this figure for a foot or more,
placing the groups an inch apart and observe the
effect. Tell him thus to make a design for the frieze
of the room. Another effect is produced by placing
a white seed as a centre and placing four or five
around it. Vary still further by placing a circle of
black seeds around the whole. These few examples
will serve to indicate the endless variety that can be
secured, and is a training in invention and taste. Let
the child always have in mind a design for some particular
purpose, as of wall-paper, oil-cloth, etc. Lead
him to observe similar effects in carpets, wall-paper,
etc. The best of these attempts can be made comparatively
permanent by pasting upon small sheets
of tinted bristol-board. The chief value in preserving
any such work is for purposes of comparison as
the child improves.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Counters</b></p>

<p>Save out 24 white and 24 black seeds for counters
in checkers, go-bang, etc.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Squash-Seed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
 Chicken</b> (<i>25 seeds</i>, <i>white thread</i>, <i>two
quill toothpicks</i>, <i>bit of red flannel</i>, <i>feather from
duster</i>)</p>

<p>Take 25 squash seeds and soak till soft. Take
five of these and place side by side with pointed ends
up. Above these place four, their
wide ends coming between the points
of the others. Above these place
three in the same relative position.
Above these put two, and above these
and between them place the squash-seed
which is to be the head of the
chicken.</p>

<p class="caption">How to String
the Seeds.</p>

</div>

<p>Now, beneath the original five,
place four, pointed ends up; beneath
these put three, then two, then one.
If these are rightly placed, the pointed
ends of one row come just at the
sides of the wide end of the seeds
above.</p>




<p>Run a thread through the lower
end of the two and the upper end of
the three; then through the lower end
of three and the upper end of the
four; continue thus till all have been
united. The result thus far will be a
double pyramid of the seeds. Draw
an eye in the middle of the head,
paste or sew on a bit of quill for a
bill and a bit of flannel for a comb.
Attach a few feathers from the
duster for a tail. Take two more seeds and sew to
the <i>middle</i> of the row of <i>five</i> for the thigh of the legs,
and to each sew a quill for the rest of the legs, cutting
into points at one end for toes.</p>

<p>Save out five seeds, and cut the cuticle of the
large end into two tiny points to simulate the ears
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
a mouse. Knot the thread and run a tiny bit
through for a tail. Paste these upon a visiting card,
and near them paste a tiny bag made of white muslin
to simulate a flour-bag. It can be stuffed with cotton
or with emery for needles or pins. Or the card
can be sewn upon several layers of cloth as decoration
for a penwiper.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Imitation Water</b></p>

<p>Muskmelon seeds placed in an undulating line
in the sand-box suggest water.</p>


<h3>SOAP</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Hammering</b> (<i>Old-fashioned bar soap</i>, <i>hammer</i>, <i>nails</i>)</p>

<p>A wee child will entertain himself for a long time
by hammering nails into a bar of soap if the proper
tools be given him. In this simple activity he exercises
both mind and body. It requires good coördination
on the part of the little one to strike the nail
just right, and he enjoys not only the exercise itself,
but also the pleasure of imitating the carpenter who
uses the hammer so skilfully.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Drawing</b> (<i>White soap</i>, <i>window-pane</i>)</p>

<p>On a day when he must stay indoors, give your
child a piece of white soap and let him show you what
he can draw upon the window-pane. Ships and trees,
houses and flowers have a fairy-like appearance when
drawn with this commonplace material upon the impromptu
background of glass. This allows the freedom
of movement found in blackboard work. It
gives scope to the child's imaginative powers and
should add nothing to the housekeeper's cares, being
readily <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
removed with a damp cloth. It may reveal
creative possibilities in some otherwise "mute, inglorious"
artist.</p>


<h3>CEREAL BOXES</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Moving-Van</b> (<i>Cereal-box</i>, <i>glue</i>, <i>two skewers</i>, <i>4 button-molds</i>,
<i>4 nails or strong pins</i>)</p>

<p>Take a box (Quaker Oats or Force, etc.). Cut
out doors and side openings for a moving-van. It
may be well to draw these first. For a model, look
at any van or grocer's wagon. It will be seen that
models are numerous and various. If more explicit
directions are required we give the following, although
it is always well to have the child use his own
mind as far as possible before going to others for
ideas.</p>

<p>Remove the top of the box, which becomes the
front of the wagon. The bottom of the box will be
the back of the wagon. This bottom will be found
to consist of two layers of cardboard. Remove the
outer one and cut the inner one once through the
middle to make two doors. On each side of the
wagon cut an oblong window &frac12; inch from the top,
&frac12; inch from the bottom, and &frac12; inch from the front.
Let it be two inches wide. Place a seat across from
one window to the other; fasten with glue. It may
be just a straight piece one inch wide, or may be two
inches wide, folded once through the middle lengthwise
to give a back.</p>

<p>For wheels use wooden button-molds, two inches
wide, or circles sawed from a broom handle. For
axles use wooden skewers or cut a piece from a stick
of kindling wood about &frac14; inch wide. Whittle the
ends till they are slender enough to hold the button-molds.
Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
put on the wheels, inserting a slender
nail or pin outside to keep them from coming off the
axle. Glue the axle to the box. If wheels are cut
from broom-handle, a nail can be driven through the
centre for an axle and then pushed into the side of
the box, or a nail pushed through a button-mold
directly into the box will hold.</p>

<p>Punch two holes into the front of the wagon,
tie cord through and the wagon can be drawn along.
It may be painted if desired. For horses, trace a
picture of a horse from some book or advertisement
on cardboard, cut out and harness to wagon.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Lantern</b> (<i>Box</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>candle</i>, <i>pencil</i>)</p>

<p>Draw on the box holes to represent eyes, nose
and mouth. Then cut these out. Cut holes near the
top of box to put wires through for carrying the
box. Use a wire about two feet long, put the ends
through the holes and bend up. Let a little of the
wax drip from the end of the candle to the bottom
of the inside of the box, and when a soft centre has
been made push the candle down and it will stand
firm. Only older children should use these, lest harm
result. But children do make them at election times
for transparencies. The openings may be lined with
colored tissue paper.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>House</b> (<i>Cereal box</i>, <i>paste</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>wall-paper</i>, <i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p>Remove one broad side. Stand box on one long
narrow side as room of doll's house. Cut an opening
in the remaining broad side for a window. Furnish
with paper furniture. (See <a href="#Page_85">page 85</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<h3>EDAM CHEESE</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Lantern</b> (<i>Cheese</i>, <i>knife</i>, <i>candle</i>)</p>

<p>After the interior of one of these round, red
cheeses has been scooped out and eaten by the family,
the discarded red shell will make a fine Jack-o'-lantern,
if the proper holes for eyes, nose and mouth be
cut into it and a candle inserted inside. The candle
may be inserted in a socket cut into the bottom of
the rind, or it may be made to stand firmly in a bed
of wax or tallow melted from its own lower end.</p>


<h3>SALT</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Play for Baby</b> (<i>Fine table salt</i>, <i>spoon</i>, <i>bottle</i>, <i>small
box or pan</i>)</p>

<p>If clean fine sand is not at the moment available,
give the baby a box containing a heap of salt and a
teaspoon and bottle, and he will be happy for a long
time, passing the salt from one bottle or box to another.
To the young mother this may seem akin to
foolishness, but in thus playing simply with sand or
with salt the baby is exercising faculties and working
out baby problems which he should be given opportunity
to try. He is becoming acquainted with his
environment, his little world.</p>


<h3>TIN CANS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Burnt-Match Safe</b> (<i>Mustard box</i>, <i>oil paints</i>, <i>brush</i>,
<i>ribbon</i>, <i>nail</i>, <i>hammer</i>)</p>

<p>Punch two holes near the upper edge of a discarded
mustard box, the holes to be opposite each
other. These may be made by hammering a nail
through <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the tin, holding the box firmly against a
block of wood or stone for pressure.</p>

<p>With oil paints, one color, begin at the top to
paint the box, graduating from light to darker tones
as the bottom is approached. Lighter tones may be
secured by mixing the blue or red with Chinese white.
A flower design may be painted by one skilled in
the use of the brush.</p>

<p>Tie ribbon through the holes by which to suspend
the box, and the result is an article both useful
and pretty.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Flower-Pot</b> (<i>Can</i>, <i>ivory paints</i>, <i>brush</i>)</p>

<p>Paint an empty can with green or brown ivory
paint and use as flower-pot for growing plant. Children
love to handle a paint-brush, and this offers a
legitimate occasion for such occupation. A small hole
should be punched in bottom of can for drainage.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Hanging-Basket</b> (<i>Can</i>, <i>nail</i>, <i>hammer</i>, <i>cord</i>, <i>raffia</i>)</p>

<p>Punch holes for suspending as described above.
Then make a covering of raffia as explained on page
46 and hang up by the cord.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Wheels</b> (<i>Covers of baking-powder tins</i>, <i>nail</i>, <i>hammer</i>)</p>

<p>With the nail, hammer a hole through the centre of
the cover, placing upon a stone step or other brace.
The little wheels may be used to complete toy wagons
that the child is making.</p>


<h3>TIN FOIL</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Dishes</b> (<i>Tin foil from cream-cheese wrappers</i>,
<i>etc</i>.)</p>

<p>Take the tin foil, and by simple squeezing and
pressing and shaping, a little practice will enable one
to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
make it into tiny pitchers, goblets, pans, etc., for
dolly's table.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Mirror</b> (<i>Tin foil</i>, <i>scissors</i>)</p>

<p>Smooth carefully with the fingers and cut a piece
of the tin foil into the shape and size to fit a little
cardboard bureau.</p>

<p>A larger piece will simulate water in the sandbox
park.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Money</b> (<i>Tin foil</i>, <i>coin</i>, <i>scissors</i>)</p>

<p>Smooth the tin foil with the thumb nail, place a
cent or a nickel beneath, and press and smooth again,
making an impression of the coin that may be cut
out and used in playing store.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Cutlery</b> (<i>Tin foil</i>, <i>scissors</i>)</p>

<p>Cut tiny knives, forks and spoons out of the tin
foil for the paper-dolls' table.</p>


<h3>CORK</h3>

<p>Save all corks and they may be used in a variety
of ways.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Raft</b> (<i>Cork</i>, <i>wire or hairpins</i>)</p>

<p>Run several corks on a piece of wire to resemble
a log; make several such and then tie together to
make a raft, tying between the corks.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Boat</b> (<i>Circular flat cork</i>, <i>tacks</i>, <i>wire</i>, <i>toothpick</i>,
<i>paper</i>)</p>

<p>Insert a toothpick in one of the large flat corks
that sometimes cover pickle glasses. Paste a paper
triangle upon this for a sail and set afloat in a dishpan
sea.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Flower-Rack</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
 (<i>Flat cork</i>, <i>pencil</i>)</p>

<p>Take a flat piece of cork such as is used by entomologists
upon which to impale insects, or any flat,
<i>thin</i> piece of cork will do if several inches in diameter.
Such cork may be easily perforated by a slender pencil.
Make a number of perforations several inches
apart, and then the cork may rest upon a water-filled
saucer or other deep dish, and the stalks of single
flowers may be inserted into the holes so that they are
supported by the cork.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Furniture</b> (<i>Circular corks</i>, <i>pins</i>, <i>worsted of pleasing
color</i>, <i>cashmere or silk goods</i>)</p>

<p>Into the upper side of a round cork about one
inch in diameter insert five to seven pins. Twist and
weave the worsted in and out, under and over those
pins, so as to make a firm, solid back to a little chair.
The ends of the worsted may be neatly disposed of
by threading on a needle and running in and out for
a few stitches till concealed.</p>

<p>For legs, insert four strong pins, and wind these
round and round with the worsted, finishing neatly
by running with a needle in and out.</p>

<p>If the seat seems too plain it may first, before
the chair is made, be covered with silk or cashmere.
To do this cut the cloth into a circle somewhat larger
than the diameter of the cork. Run a gathering
thread around the circumference, and putting the
cork in the centre draw the thread and so gather beneath
the seat. To make a really neat finish the edge
should be turned in before gathering.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Swimming-Float</b> (<i>Dozens of corks</i>, <i>strong canvas
cloth, measuring 20 × 36 inches</i>, <i>needle</i>, <i>thread</i>)</p>

<p>Make two strong canvas bags, measuring about
18 × 20 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
inches. Fill these with corks to act as floats.
Unite the two bags by a strong band of canvas about
7 × 20 inches in size, and let the children use when
in bathing.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Cork in Art</b></p>

<p>In making models of world-renowned buildings,
such as churches, cathedrals, temples, etc., cork is
used in large and small pieces.</p>

<p>In Germany it is used in making pictures. A
sky background is painted in water-color, and the
flat pieces of cork are cut into shape and glued on
to represent walls and towers of buildings. The
foliage of trees is represented by the more spongy
pieces of cork, and the effects secured are interesting
and beautiful. The children may like to experiment
and see what they can do in this direction.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
<br />
MOTHER NATURE'S HORN OF PLENTY</h2>


<p>Many of the articles named under the Market
Basket Division of this book could be classified also
under the above head. In addition we present the
following:</p>


<h3>STONES AND PEBBLES</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Collections</b> (<i>Stones</i>, <i>small boxes</i>)</p>

<p>Collect various pretty little stones and pebbles on
river shore, coast or roadway, and classify in different
ways&mdash;according to color, shape, size. This exercises
the child's observing powers and trains him in detecting
differences and resemblances. Keep in small boxes.</p>


<p class="hang2"><a name="Bottled_Pebbles" id="Bottled_Pebbles"></a><b>Bottled Pebbles</b> (<i>Pebbles</i>, <i>plain glass bottle</i>)</p>

<p>Put some pretty pebbles in a glass bottle filled
with water which intensifies the color. Send to some
sick friend, especially some one from the prairies who
may seldom see stones. It is always well for the
child to have some definite object in view when he
does anything.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Path-Markers</b></p>

<p>Use pebbles in the sand-box for outlining the little
paths in the wee park or farm.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Jackstones</b></p>

<p>Pebbles of right size and shape make good jackstones.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Vegetables</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
 (<i>Small square of cheesecloth</i>, <i>needle</i>,
<i>thread</i>, <i>pebbles</i>)</p>

<p>Make tiny cheesecloth bags and use pebbles as
potatoes, apples, etc., in play with the little wagons
made by the child. In playing store with them comes
opportunity for counting and measuring. Tiny boxes
can be used for quart and pint measures, and the child
may be shown that two pints make one quart, etc.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Paper-Weight</b> (<i>Large, smooth stone</i>, <i>oil-paints</i>)</p>

<p>If you find a large, smooth stone of pretty tone,
let the older child decorate it with a little picture done
in oil paints.</p>


<h3>SHELLS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Collections</b> (<i>Shells</i>, <i>small boxes</i>)</p>

<p>Collect and classify according to color, shape,
etc., and keep in separate boxes.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Bottled Shells</b> (<i>Shells</i>, <i>bottle</i>)</p>

<p>Put little shells in bottle of water to bring out
lovely colors. (See <a href="#Bottled_Pebbles">Bottled Pebbles</a> above.)</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Border for Sand-Table</b></p>

<p>Place small shells along little paths in sand-table,
sometimes with concave side up and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>Larger shells, as clamshells, make fine borders
for roads and paths in the country. They outline the
road on a dark night.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Water-Color-Cups</b></p>

<p>Collect and save shells to give to some artist
friend as extra cups for his water-color paints.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Ramekin Dishes</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Large shells make serviceable individual dishes
for baked fish, etc. Appropriate for fish dinner.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Individual Salt and Butter Dishes</b></p>

<p>These can be made of the smaller pink and yellow
shells found on many coasts. Let the children collect
shells for this purpose, and use for fish dinner.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy-Boat</b></p>

<p>A small shell is often found which, with the little
natural seat found at one end, at once suggests a little
boat. Have the children collect and save for those
far from the shore.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Pin-Tray</b> (<i>Scallop shell</i>, <i>oil-paints</i>)</p>

<p>Paint a marine view in oils inside a shell for pin-tray.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Pin-Cushion</b> (<i>Small piece of satin or velvet</i>, <i>saw-dust</i>,
<i>glue</i>, <i>two perfect scallop-shells</i>)</p>

<p>Make a small pin-cushion of satin or velvet, filled
with saw-dust, and glue between a pair of scallop
shells, so that it fits in between as they open out.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Piano Scarf</b> (<i>Several dozen small, thin, yellow shells
found on Atlantic coast</i>, <i>one yard Nile green
India silk</i>, <i>strong sewing silk</i>)</p>

<p>Hem the silk an inch deep at each end. Sew to
one end a fringe of shells made as follows:</p>

<p>The shells usually have a tiny hole in them when
found. If not, one is easily pierced by a strong
needle. Take twelve lengths of strong sewing silk,
white, each 20 inches long. To each of these tie
twelve shells at intervals of an inch each. You will
then <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
have twelve strings of shells, which are to be
sewed to the scarf as a fringe, putting them about
three inches apart. Sew two rows of shells directly
on the scarf itself, putting them about four inches
apart each way. If desired, in making the fringe
some of the strings may be shorter than others, arranged
so that the long and short ones alternate.</p>


<h3>BIRCH BARK</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Needle-Case or Penwiper</b> (<i>Squares of chamois skin
or flannel</i>, <i>sewing-silk</i>, <i>paint</i>)</p>

<p>Cut bark into circles, squares, oblongs, etc. Decorate
with gold lettering or borders of gold. Make
several leaves of flannel or chamois skin and sew the
bark on to these as a cover. The flannel may be scalloped.
An appropriate sentiment to write upon penwiper
cover is "Extracts from the pen of&mdash;" putting
in the name of the recipient. The leaves and cover
may be sewed together with a cross-stitch.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Handkerchief-Box</b> (<i>Punch</i>, <i>several strands of raffia</i>)</p>

<p>Cut two pieces of bark 6 × 6 inches. Cut four
others 3 × 6 inches. Along the edge of these punch
(with a conductor's punch or one that can be bought
at a kindergarten supply place) holes an inch apart
and &frac14; inch from edge. Sew the four narrow pieces
to the square for bottom and sides of box. Sew
remaining square more loosely to one side as cover.
Sew with strands of raffia, sewing through the holes
already made. If desired to give a more finished appearance
punch more holes along edge of box and lid,
making them &frac14; inch apart. Then hold a fine basket
reed or piece of raffia along the edges and overcast.
If <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
lavender or sweet grass is obtainable, that will
be even better than reed or raffia for the edge, lending
its fragrance to the gift. The box can be still
further finished by lining with dainty silk. Make
glove box in same way, but longer in proportion to
width.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Pencil and Paint-Brush Box</b> (<i>Bark</i>, <i>raffia</i>, <i>needle or
crochet hook</i>)</p>

<p>This is cylindrical. Cut a piece of bark 5 × 8
inches. Punch in it a series of holes &frac34; of an inch
apart, and &frac12; inch from edge of each short side.
Place these so that one edge overlaps the other and
the holes coincide with one another. Then sew together
with raffia. Use a short needle or none at all.
Raffia can be drawn through holes with a crochet-hook.
Punch holes in the lower end of this cylinder
and cut a circle of same size as diameter of cylinder
out of cardboard. Punch corresponding holes in
this and sew the bottom in. Strengthen top by overcasting
over a twist of raffia, sweet grass or sweet
clover.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Canoe</b> (<i>Bark</i>, <i>pencil</i>, <i>thread</i>, <i>paper</i>, <i>paraffine</i>)</p>

<p>Fold strong piece of bark and cut an outline of
a canoe, rounding the ends. Sew the ends closely
together with stout thread, overcasting the edges with
same. Make watertight by lining with paper dipped
in melted paraffine. Paraffine may be bought at grocer's.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Fan</b>, modeled after East Indian pattern (<i>Bark</i>, <i>kindling
wood</i>, <i>dye</i>, <i>gold paint</i>)</p>

<p>Cut two stiff pieces of bark into hatchet-shaped
trapezoid. Punch row of holes in the narrowest side,
whittle <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
a handle of pinewood, and sew it to the narrow
edge of bark over and over through the holes.</p>

<p>The handle may be stained with some natural
dye and fan decorated with gold paint.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Picture-Frame</b> (<i>Bark</i>, <i>punch</i>, <i>sweet grass</i>)</p>

<p>Cut two pieces of bark 4 × 5 inches, one of smooth
bark, one of the outer bark with pleasing markings.
Punch holes around the edges of each &frac34; inches apart.
In the rough outside piece cut an oval 2&frac12; × 3 inches.
Around this inner oval punch holes near together and
bind this around with sweet grass overcast with fine
raffia. Now sew the two pieces of bark together,
first cutting into the back piece a slit near the bottom
into which to slide the photograph.</p>

<p>In using sweet grass as binding it is well to wind
the bunch first with thread to hold the pieces together,
and after the grass is firmly sewed the temporary
thread can be cut away. The bunch of grass thus
used may be about as thick as half the little finger.</p>

<p>Punch may be bought at kindergarten store, or
conductor's punch will do.</p>


<h3>GOURDS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Darning-Egg</b></p>

<p>A smooth well-shaped gourd (mock-orange)
makes a serviceable darning egg.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Hanging-Basket</b> (<i>Large gourd</i>, <i>soil</i>, <i>plant</i>)</p>

<p>Clear the gourd of fibre and seeds, after cutting
off the top rim evenly. Pierce the top with two holes
through which to attach cord for hanging, fill with a
light, loose soil, and plant in it a drooping, trailing
plant. Cut a hole in the lower end to allow for drainage.
Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
 the country child save gourds of good
shape to present, thus filled, to city friends.</p>


<h3>VEGETABLES</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Sweet-Potato Vine</b></p>

<p>Put a sweet potato in sandy loam in a hanging
basket and water occasionally. It will produce a beautiful,
graceful vine.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Carrot-Top</b></p>

<p>Cut off the top of a young carrot evenly and place
it on top of a pot filled with sand. Moisten well, and
keep in the dark till it has begun to sprout; when the
leaves appear take it out, and the word "Carrot-top"
will acquire a new meaning, the result is so pretty.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Turnip</b></p>

<p>Take a turnip and clean the outside, taking care
not to injure the parts from which the leaves spring.
Cut a piece off the bottom and scoop out the inside,
leaving the top intact. Fasten string or wire to it
so as to hang it upside down. Fill and keep filled
with water, and soon the leaves will sprout and curl
up, forming a beautiful natural hanging basket.</p>


<h3>RAFFIA</h3>

<p>This flexible fiber, long used by florists, is now
also used a great deal in the schools for the educational
hand-training it affords. It can be obtained
at kindergarten supply places.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Reins</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Take three to six strands and braid into reins
for playing horse. As the ends of the strands are
approached (each is about a yard long) begin to
weave in a new strand, as inconspicuously as possible.
Do not have the strands all exactly the same
length to begin with, because if you reach the end
of all at the same time it makes it difficult to weave
in new ones neatly.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Mat</b></p>

<p>Take such a long braid as described above, and
holding one end flat, turn it round and round spirally
but flat, and sew with thread to make a mat for the
tea-pot. By bending up a little as you sew you can
make a basket.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Picture-Frame</b> (<i>Cardboard</i>, <i>raffia</i>, <i>thread and needle</i>)</p>

<p>Cut a circle of cardboard 5 × 5 inches in diameter.
From the centre cut out a smaller circle three
inches in diameter. This leaves a circular cardboard
frame. Wind this round and round smoothly with
the raffia. Paste another circle on the back to give

<h3>LEAVES</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Festoons and Wreaths</b> (<i>Leaves, fresh or dried</i>,
<i>thorns or needle and thread</i>)</p>

<p>City children may need to be told what seems to
be handed down to the country child from generation
to generation, that leaves may be made into wreaths
for the head or decoration for the room either by
overlapping one upon another and fastening together
with a thorn or sharp twig, or by stringing together
on a stout thread.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>To Dry or Press</b> (<i>Blotting paper</i>, <i>two small smooth
boards</i>, <i>strap</i>, <i>wax or linseed oil</i>)</p>

<p>Gather and press pretty autumn leaves thus:
Have ready two boards measuring about one by two
feet. Put the leaves between sheets of blotting paper
and place these between the boards and then strap
them tightly together, or if no straps are convenient,
put the boards beneath a heavy weight (a book will
do). Change the paper every day or so till sure that
they are quite dry.</p>

<p>To preserve and brighten the colors after drying
dip in melted wax and press a moment with a hot
iron, or clear, boiled linseed oil will do in place of
the wax, using, however, as little as possible.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Decoration for Curtains</b></p>

<p>Pin to lace curtains in attractive arrangement.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Transparency</b> (<i>Leaves</i>, <i>bolting-cloth</i>, <i>1 yard white
India silk</i>, <i>sewing silk</i>, <i>needle</i>)</p>

<p>1. Take a piece of bolting-cloth twice the length
of the largest leaf and fold over evenly. Open again
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
place the leaves upon the bolting-cloth artistically
in a row; fold the cloth over again and baste. Bind
the edges with white ribbon, and at the two upper
corners sew the ends of a narrow ribbon with which
to suspend the transparency in the window.</p>

<p>2. Or, if preferred, sew the bolting-cloth transparency
as a border to the end of a yard of India
silk as a scarf for shelf or piano.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Frieze of Leaves</b> (<i>Leaves</i>, <i>cartridge or other strong
paper of good tone</i>, <i>glue</i>)</p>

<p>A pretty frieze for a room can be made by pasting
leaves on a long, foot-high strip of paper which
forms a background. The effect will depend largely
upon the harmony between the color of the leaves
and the background, as well as upon the arrangement
of the leaves. They may be arranged in an irregular
line, or may be placed so as to form artistic groups
of twos and threes or fours.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Collections of Leaves</b></p>

<p>When the collecting instinct is upon him, let the
child collect and classify leaves according to shape.
See if he can tell by the leaf what tree it came from,
and if he recognizes the different varieties of leaves.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Four-Leaved Clovers</b></p>

<p>Look for four-leaved clovers when on your country
walks, and save to press and afterwards use in
writing letters of good-will as decoration for paper,
pasting on at upper left hand corner; or use to decorate
place cards for dinners. It will hardly be necessary
to state that the four-leaved clover has for long
years been the symbol of good-luck.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Shadow Game</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
 (<i>See under <a href="#Shadow_Game">Sun and Shadow</a></i> )</p>


<h3>FEATHERS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Feather Flowers</b> (<i>A large goose with many white
feathers</i>, <i>beeswax</i>, <i>spools of wire of different sizes</i>,
<i>aniline dyes, though vegetable dyes are preferable
if obtainable</i>, <i>strong scissors suitable for cutting
wire</i>, <i>spools of strong white cotton thread</i>, <i>spool
of milliner's green-covered wire</i>)</p>

<p>Pluck the breast of the goose. (Feathers come out
very easily.) The feathers, being very light, fly about
and therefore it is best to do the plucking in an uncarpeted
room or one in which the floor has been covered
with a large sheet.</p>

<p>Classify the feathers according to size, and arrange
in bundles of about thirty by winding a stout
thread around the quills. Thus they are ready for the
dyeing process.</p>

<p>Dye according to directions on packages. For
deep green of leaves and for calyx immerse for several
minutes; for more delicate tints immersion for a
second is sufficient.</p>

<p>Suppose we select for our first effort a carnation.
Choose a real one for a model. Having selected about
twenty feathers of the required sizes and colors, cut
the ends to resemble the form of the petal and then
pink the edge as in the real flower. The actual number
of petals required will depend upon the size of the
flower copied and must be left to the judgment of the
maker.</p>

<p>Take the measure of the length of stem required
on the wire and double it (wire must be twice as long
as stem). Wind tightly and evenly around it the
green milliner's wire to make the stem.</p>

<p>Soften <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the beeswax by heating slightly in a pan
till soft enough to mold between the fingers. Shape it
into the form of the calyx, inserting the stem at the
lower end, and pushing it far enough to insure firmness.
Wrap this soft calyx form round with green
feathers to represent the flower copied. Upon accuracy
at the beginning depends the success of the flower,
therefore it is necessary to observe the natural one
closely. The green feathers must entirely cover the
calyx mold, the upper ones curving back a little as in
the genuine calyx.</p>

<p>Take some colored petals and insert between the
calyx and the wax mold, pushing the quill end of the
feather firmly into the wax. Arrange the petals spirally,
beginning at the bottom and building gradually
up to the top. The larger feathers are used first, growing
smaller toward the top. Complete the flower by
inserting the stamens and pistil, which are made by
tearing one small feather into narrow strips and curling
these by drawing once over a scissors blade.</p>

<p>The simplest flowers to make are: Carnation
pinks, violets, sweet peas, fuchsias, roses and Easter
lilies. With the proper amount of time, patience and
perseverance, any flower can be successfully made.</p>

<p>If leaves are desired, cut green feathers into the
required shape and attach.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Indian Headdress</b> (<i>Large turkey feathers</i>, <i>glue</i>, <i>cardboard</i>,
<i>paint</i>)</p>

<p>Save large feathers from turkey or rooster and
make Indian headdress by glueing upon cardboard cut
to proper shape. For model look at copper cent.</p>

<h3>FLOWERS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Pressed Morning-Glories</b> (<i>The flowers</i>, <i>white tissue-paper</i>,
<i>scissors</i>, <i>book or pressing boards</i>)</p>

<p>Press the flowers between a fold of thin tissue-paper.
The delicate flowers will adhere to the paper,
which is sufficiently transparent however for the morning-glory
to be visible through it. When dry, cut the
paper from around the flower and pin to curtains, lambrequin,
etc., as desired, or attach to letter paper.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Soldier-Flowers</b> (<i>Milkweed blossoms</i>)</p>

<p>The small blossoms of the milkweed may be made
to stand in rows and columns like soldiers, two by two,
four by four, etc., giving practice in counting.</p>


<h3>ROSE-HAWS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Rosaries</b> (<i>Haws</i>, <i>stout thread</i>, <i>needle</i>)</p>

<p>When the beautiful red rose-haws ripen let the
children string them, making rosaries to send to city
friends.</p>


<h3>STRAWS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Stringing</b> (<i>Scissors</i>, <i>needle</i>, <i>thread</i>, <i>cranberries</i>, <i>nuts</i>,
<i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p>Save the straw from rye and let the children cut
it into one-inch lengths for stringing alternately with
cranberries, nuts, beads, etc. Use to decorate the room,
to make portieres, and to decorate the child himself
when dressing up.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Blowing Bubbles</b> (<i>Straw</i>, <i>soapy water</i>)</p>

<p>Hollow straws several inches long may be used to
blow tiny bubbles of soapy water in the absence of a
clay pipe.</p>

<h3>SUN AND SHADOW</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Blue-Prints</b> (<i>Leaf</i>, <i>blue-print paper</i>, <i>running water</i>,
<i>small oblong of glass</i>)</p>

<p>A package of blue-print paper can be bought at
any photographic supply place for from 15 cents up,
or can be had in the sheet from an architect's supply
store. It must be carefully protected from the light
till ready for use.</p>

<p>Take a square of the paper and place upon it a
leaf or flower or inconspicuous weed that makes a good
shadow on the sidewalk or window sill. Place this in
pleasing position upon the paper and put quickly in the
bright sunshine, holding it in place with the small
pane of glass (common picture glass will do). Leave
exposed to the sun for about ten minutes, then pour
cold water over it for a moment or so, and the
"shadow" will be seen to be permanently "fixed" in
light blue against a darker blue background.</p>

<p>An artist acquaintance has a hundred or more
such prints of leaves, plants and flowers beautifully
mounted in a Japanese blank-book, the paper of which
makes an exquisite background. She finds these
shadows of the flowers and commonest weeds suggestive
in her designing.</p>

SAVED FROM THE SCRAP BASKET</h2>

<p class="center">or</p>

<p class="center pb"><span class="smcap">Work with Scissors and Paste</span></p>


<p>What is known as free-hand cutting has been for
some time recognized as of genuine educational value
and is a source of great pleasure to the child when
once he learns his capacity in this direction. When
he tries, by means of paper and scissors, to express
an idea, to illustrate some story, or to indicate
something that he has seen, his notions of form and
proportion become more definite and precise, and he
learns to express action with remarkable skill and
power. He learns to appreciate beauty of outline as
seen in mountains and trees against a clear sky, and
to recognize such beauty as there may be in what
artists know as the "sky line," when darkness deepens
and the mammoth buildings of a city loom up
black against the sunset heavens. The definiteness of
observation and skill with the hand acquired in this
free cutting serves the child in many ways when in
the school grades.</p>

<p>Many an otherwise useless piece of paper may,
with the help of scissors, give the child hours of
pleasure.</p>

<p>But before he is able to use the scissors the
child may receive pleasure and benefit from the use
of paper alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<h3>PAPER</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Tearing Paper</b> (<i>Any bit of paper</i>)</p>

<p>Give the children small pieces of paper and let
them try to tear these into simple definite shapes.
Make a shoe, stocking, snowman, tree, ladder, cat, etc.
Watch that they do not grow nervous in doing it.
After a little practice they will become surprisingly
expert. Paste what they make on a good background
to save and compare with later efforts.</p>

<p>This is a really educational occupation which involves
absolutely no expense, as any clean piece of
paper may be so used. Will employ the child happily
when traveling.</p>

<p>The very youngest children, if they want to tear
the newspaper, may be asked to tear it into tiny
pieces which brother and sister can use in playing
"hare and hounds."</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Cutting Paper</b></p>

<p>Let the child begin the <i>cutting</i> by making a snowball
out of white paper, and then a snowman. These
need only crude outlines, such as are within his capacity.
Then lead him on, little by little, to cut a picture
of the cat and of the dog, and illustrations to his
favorite stories, as the "Three Bears." This is beloved
in the kindergarten, requiring, as it does, pictures
of the chairs, the bowls, etc. Those who have
not seen children do this kind of work will be surprised
at the capacity developed.</p>

<p class="pb">If he is afraid to attempt the freehand work, give
the child pictures to cut around, as simple outlines
of a cat seated, or a piece of fruit. Then encourage
him to cut without the outline. Both efforts may run
along <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
together. If a line be drawn, be sure that it is
heavy and distinct enough to be readily seen and followed.</p>

<p>Out of red paper let the child cut six (or any
number desired) narrow strips for red candles, to
represent birthday candles. Place in a row upon a
white card, to serve as place cards at a child's party.
Draw a bit of yellow at end of each candle to hint
at a flame.</p>

<p>The same may be turned into firecrackers for a
"Fourth of July" festival, a line being drawn to suggest
a fuse.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Soldier-Caps</b> (<i>Newspaper</i>, <i>pins or paste</i>)</p>

<p>Take brown wrapping paper or newspaper and
cut a square. Place before you and fold from <i>back</i>
to <i>front</i>, making an oblong. <i>While still folded</i> make
another fold by turning the left edge so that it exactly
meets the right edge. Open this much out and there
is a crease running from top to bottom. Now take
the upper left hand corner and make it touch the bottom
of this crease; take the upper right hand corner
and make it touch the lower end of this crease. This
gives a pointed cap, still unfinished. To finish cut a
slit, an inch deep, up from each lower end of the cap
and then fold a kind of hem up from the bottom and
paste the ends over neatly. Turn the hat over and
fold a similar hem on the other side. Turn in the
corner and finish by pasting neatly.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Plume for Hat</b> (<i>Paper as above</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>paste or
pin</i>)</p>

<p>Take a strip of paper 6 × 12 inches. Make a
fringe <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
or series of cuts in this about four inches long
and &frac12; inch wide, and then roll it up and attach to
hat with paste or a pin.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Epaulets</b> for shoulder may be cut in similar way.</p>

<p>The cutting of these fringes gives practice in the
use of scissors.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The articles whose making we will now describe
do not come under the head of free-hand cutting, as
they usually require cutting according to measurement,
and really definite directions. They are given
in general in the order of difficulty in the making.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Chains</b> (<i>Scissors</i>, <i>paper</i>, <i>paste</i>, <i>toothpick</i>)</p>

<p>Let the little child begin by cutting strips of
some bright paper or smooth wrapping paper into
lengths of &frac12; by 3 inches. Make a ring of one of these,
putting a wee bit of paste on the under part of one
end and sticking it fast to the other end by overlapping.
Through this ring run another strip and
paste into a similar ring, and so make a long chain
of them wherewith to decorate the child's small person
or the room. To make paste see <a href="#Page_169">page 169</a>.</p>

<p>It is well to have a small pomade box, obtainable
at a druggist's, in which to keep the paste. It
can then be covered and kept moist until the next
time for using. But a little fresh mucilage or paste
can at any time be put into a butter dish. A toothpick
will make a good paste-stick, which the child
can handle more easily than a brush. Show him that
a tiny bit of paste will suffice and that more makes
the pretty ring mussy.</p>

<p>If mother is sewing and the child restless and
no bright colored paper convenient, let the child cut
strips <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of newspaper right at hand and make the rings.
His imagination will readily convert them into links
of gold.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Mask</b> (<i>Paper of any color</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>chalk</i>, <i>cord</i>)</p>

<p>Cut an oval out of paper (or dress-lining) and
in it cut holes for eyes, nose, and mouth, fitting first
to the child's face to insure getting them in the right
places. Put a hole in the middle of each side through
which to tie the string which fastens it around over
the head. To add to the fun the mask may be colored
with chalks.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Newspaper Wrappers</b> (<i>Smooth brown wrapping
paper</i>, <i>pencil</i>, <i>ruler</i>)</p>

<p>Take smooth pieces of brown wrapping paper.
Cut oblongs 8 × 12 inches. From one narrow edge
then measure an inch down on each side and make a
dot. Make another dot at the middle of this same
narrow side. Then draw a curve from dot to dot
and cut along the line. This makes the curved edge
of the wrapper. The curve may be cut free hand by
a skilful hand, or drawn with a compass. Put some
mucilage all along the edge of the curved side about
&frac12; inch wide and let dry. Make a dozen of these and
give to father for a present, all ready for use when
he wants to mail a paper. They can be made more
complete by affixing a one-cent stamp on the right
hand side where the curved edge begins.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Papers for Baking Pans</b> (<i>Brown paper</i>, <i>scissors</i>,

<p>Take a piece of dainty paper and cut into an
oblong 1 × 6 inches. Fold lengthwise and cut a small
triangle from each end so as to leave a point when
opened out. Now cut a circle in the middle of the
paper (which is still folded) and cut other shaped
openings, diamonds, triangles, etc., along the fold,
&frac12; or &frac34; inches apart. Open and you have a simple
openwork bookmark the little child can give father
for birthday. A little experiment will show how to
secure variety and intricacy of design.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Fringed Bon-Bon Papers</b> (<i>White tissue paper</i>, <i>colored

<p>Cut a sheet of tissue paper into little oblongs
4 × 5 inches. Dip each narrow end &frac34; of an inch
into ink, red, green, etc., or into water-color paints,
and let dry. Then cut this colored margin into narrow
slits, making fringe. Copy some appropriate
couplet on a narrow slip of paper and place it with
a piece of candy inside the paper, giving the fringed
ends a final twist. The making of these at home for
some future occasion, such as a birthday party, will
afford a happy hour's amusement.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Paper Money</b> (<i>White paper</i>, <i>pencil</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>cent</i>)</p>

<p>Place the cent beneath the paper and then press
on it with the bottom of the pencil, rubbing at the
same time with a circular motion. Soon the impression
of the coin will appear on the paper. Cut out
and use in playing store.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Snowflakes</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
(<i>White paper</i>, <i>mucilage</i>, <i>a ten-cent box
of mica crystals or five cents' worth of alum
powder</i>)</p>

<p>A six-pointed star must first be made of white
paper. To make this take piece of the paper from 3
to 6 inches square, according to the size of the star.
Fold the paper once and cut an approximate half circle.
Then fold this in thirds, pressing the folds to
make creases. If opened out the circle would be
marked by six equi-distant creases radiating from the
centre. Do not, however, open, for you are now ready
to cut. Before doing this, observe if possible some
real snowflakes, with microscope or magnifying glass,
or even with the naked eye. Notice the form and
hexagonal structure. This is seen best if the flake
is caught on some woolen fabric. Then look into an
unabridged dictionary and study the picture of the
magnified snowflake crystal. Then cut tiny triangles,
circles, etc., into your folded circle so that
when opened out it will suggest an enlarged snowflake
with its six varied points. A delicate appearance
is secured by cutting delicate tapering points,
or, if the points be broad, cut holes in them to give
a lacey effect. We do not give more definite directions
for cutting, as the great fascination of the occupation
consists in the experiments with their many
surprises.</p>

<p>(1) Now take the paper snowflake and brush it
lightly over with a thin, transparent mucilage, and
then sift over it some mica crystals obtainable at a
toy-store, one box being sufficient for many flakes.
After drying, cover the other side in the same way.
Suspended from the Christmas tree, these are very
effective.</p>

<p>(2) The flakes can be made in another way,
thus: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Make a solution of alum water, dissolving
five cents' worth of alum in a pint of water. Be sure
it is all dissolved. Then put the flakes in a shallow
dish (granite ware or some material that the acid will
not injure). Cover with the solution and put in a
place slightly warm, so that the gradual evaporation
of the water will help in the slow formation of the
crystals. When finally evaporated the lacey "cut-out"
will be found covered with alum crystals. Cover
during evaporation with some light protection from
the dust.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Tailless Kite</b> (<i>Two sticks, 3&frac12; feet long and &frac12; inch
wide</i>, <i>a ball of strong but thin twine</i>, <i>two pieces
tissue paper</i>, <i>knife</i>, <i>flour paste</i>)</p>

<p>Get the sticks from the saw-mill. Cut a notch
in the two ends of each stick as a catch for the framework
of twine which will be put on later. On one
stick make a pencil mark about seven inches from the
top. Put the middle of the second stick across the
first at this mark and bind the two together firmly
at right angles to each other. You now have a
skeleton in the form of a cross. Number the ends of
the sticks 1, 2, 3, 4, making the top 1, the right hand
end 2, the bottom 3, and the left hand 4, and the
place where they join 5.</p>

<p>Now bend the second stick (the cross piece) into
a bow and tie a piece of twine from end to end like a
bow-string. You must get the curve of the bow just
right, so that the distance from the middle of the
bow-string to the joinings of the sticks is the same
as from the joinings of the sticks to the top of the
main stick, <i>i. e.</i>, seven inches.</p>

<p>Now carry twine all around, from end to end
of the skeleton, to make a framework for the paper;
put <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
this twine through each notch and around the end
of the stick several times to strengthen. Now paste
together, end to end, lengthwise, the two pieces of
paper, to make one long piece (a single piece is not
large enough). Place the paper on the floor or broad
table, and lay the frame upon it. The paper will not
be as long or wide in all places as the framework,
hence, fold it over the twine framework experimentally,
and cut off in places where it is too wide.
Allow enough for secure pasting. Use the cut-off
corners to lengthen in other places where necessary,
by pasting on. If two colors of paper are taken,
the effect is very pretty, the corners being arranged
to match each other. The best paste is made by a
judicious mixture of ordinary flour and water.</p>

<p>Now the belly-band must be tied on, as the flying
string is attached to the belly-band. The belly-band
is attached on the outside or convex side of the
kite, being attached at 5 where the two sticks join;
and at 3. It must be just as long as the distance
from 5 to 2 added to the distance from 2 to 3. When
tied at both ends put your pencil through the loop and
move it so that the pencil rests upon the figure 2.
The cord will then make an angle coinciding with
5-2 and 2-3. At the angle 2, attach the belly-band.</p>

<p>In flying the kite it is important to have a very
long flying-string.</p>


<h3>CARDBOARD OR BRISTOL BOARD</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Go-Bang Board</b> (<i>Bristol board</i>, <i>ruler</i>, <i>ink</i>, <i>pen</i>, <i>button-molds</i>,
<i>water-color paints or colored inks</i>)</p>

<p>Get a piece of bristol board or clean cardboard at
stationer's and cut it 18 inches square. Divide by
straight lines into small squares &frac34; inches each way.</p>

<p>To <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
draw the straight lines in ink turn the ruler
upside down and run the penholder against the edge,
which is a little raised from the paper. This keeps
the ink from blotting.</p>

<p>Four is the smallest number that can play with
much success, and each should have about a dozen
counters. These can be made of the smallest sized
button-molds, each set of 12 painted a different color,
or distinguished by a ring of a particular color drawn
upon its upper surface with ink or paint. Small flat
buttons may also be used.</p>

<p>To win the game each player must succeed in
getting a certain number of counters (number previously
agreed upon), say four, five or six, in a
straight row, either horizontally, vertically or obliquely.
If he gets three in a row, then the next
player should stop this opponent's progress at one
end of the line by putting one of his own men there,
and must depend upon his neighbor to close the other
end of the line. One player must not give warning
to another of the prospective success of a third. Each
must keep a lookout on his own account.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Checker-Board</b> (<i>Bristol board or any stiff, smooth
cardboard</i>, <i>smooth, glazed paper of two colors,
red and black</i>, <i>paste</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>ruler</i>)</p>

<p>Cut from the cardboard a square of 15 inches.
Draw a line parallel to each side one inch from the
edge for a border. From each colored sheet of paper
cut 32 squares of 1&frac34; inches each. Paste eight of
these in a row, alternating colors, and arranging so
that they just touch the top border line. Make eight
such rows, one beneath the other, and finally giving
64 squares.</p>

<p>For checkers, button-molds of small size may be
used. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Twelve will be needed of one color and twelve
of another. Paint these with water-colors. Flat
porcelain buttons may also be used.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Screen</b> (<i>Tinted cardboard</i>, <i>punch</i>, <i>worsted or
ribbon</i>, <i>4 small pictures</i>)</p>

<p>Cut four pieces of pale blue Bristol board 3 × 4
inches. Punch two holes in the two long sides of
two of these, and in one side of each of the remaining
ones. Tie the four panels together with the ribbon
or worsted so as to make a tiny screen, first pasting
on each panel a miniature picture of a Madonna and
Child or some other similar subject. Suitable for
child to give as Christmas gift. Must be done neatly.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Fan</b> (<i>Bristol board</i>, <i>pencil</i>, <i>worsted</i>, <i>two slats</i>, <i>scrap
picture</i>)</p>

<p>Cut two pieces of tinted Bristol board into ovals,
6&frac34; × 8 inches. Make a series of pencil dots &frac14; inch
from edge of oval and one inch apart. Through
these, holding the ovals together, punch holes. Sew
together with worsted, using the overhand stitch.
Having gone around once, if cross-stitch effect is
desired, go around again the other way, going thus
through each hole a second time. For handles take
two long slats and glue on to each side of the fan
from the centre down to the point of the oval, and
beyond. Paste a pretty scrap picture over the centre
to finish off. Tie the worsted around the ends of
slats in a pretty knot to hold them together. Baby
ribbon may be used instead of worsted.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Cardboard Animals</b> (<i>Glue</i>, <i>blocks or spools</i>, <i>picture-books</i>,
<i>cardboard</i>, <i>tissue paper</i>)</p>

<p>Find models in picture-books, or get from Butterick
Fashion <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Co. their animal pictures, or same may
be had from kindergarten supply stores. Trace outline
upon tissue paper, using soft pencil. Turn paper
over on cardboard and trace firmly again around the
outline. This leaves impression of picture. Cut it
out and glue it to block or spool, or attach a cardboard
brace to one side to make stand.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Candlesticks</b> (<i>Squares of bright tissue paper</i>, <i>Bristol
board</i>, <i>rubber bands</i>)</p>

<p>Cut circle of stiff cardboard 5 inches in diameter.
Draw upon it two diameters at right angles to each
other. From the <i>centre</i> cut along each of these diameters
for a little less than half an inch. Bend up the
corners thus made and insert a candle.</p>

<p>Cut pieces of tissue paper 12 inches square; place
the circle holding the candle upon the tissue paper,
fold the latter around the circle and the candle, and
put a rubber band around to hold in place. The appearance
is improved if two colors of tissue paper be
used. The effect up and down a table of these simple
candlesticks is most festive. Colors may be changed
to suit special occasions.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Chinese Toy</b> (<i>Three thin pieces of cardboard 2 × 2&frac12;
inches in measurement</i> [<i>visiting cards will do</i>],
<i>6 lengths of taffeta binding or baby ribbon, &frac14;
inch wide × 3 inches long</i>)</p>

<p>The following toy can be made with little expense
and very little trouble if directions are followed
explicitly. It may be well to have an older child read
each statement as the less experienced one tries to
follow. A child who enjoys attempting things that
are a little difficult will enjoy working this out.</p>

<p>Place <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the three cards one beneath the other, narrow
sides facing each other.</p>

<p>Letter the cards respectively A,
B, C.</p>

<div class="figright"><a id="i_066" name="i_066"></a>
<img src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="i_066" />

<p class="caption">Chinese Toy.</p>

</div>


<p>As they lie on the table, write on
upper side of each card "right," and
on the under side write "wrong."</p>

<p>Then place each card so that the
"right" side is up.</p>

<p>Take card A and on <i>right</i> side
at middle of top place figure 1 and at
each lower corner place a figure 2.</p>

<p>Do the same with Card B.</p>

<p>Turn B card over and on <i>wrong</i>
side of B put figure 3 at each upper
corner and figure 4 at middle of
lower edge.</p>

<p>Do same with card C on <i>wrong</i>
side.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to unite the
cards by the ribbons.</p>

<p>Take one strip of ribbon and
paste one end on right side of card A
at figure 1. Run it beneath the card
and bring it out so as to paste the
other end on the right side of card B
at figure 1.</p>

<p>Take <i>two</i> strips. Paste one end
of each at 2 on card A. Run beneath
card B and turn up over so as to
paste on figure 2 of card B.</p>

<p>A and B are thus loosely united
and the toy may be considered finished, but it is more
mysterious if made longer, as follows:</p>

<p>Turn over and at each figure 3 on card B paste
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
ends of two strips of ribbon. (As ribbons already
placed are loose this can be readily done.)</p>

<p>Run beneath B and bring up so as to paste the
ends on each figure 3 of card C.</p>

<p>Take another strip. Paste the end on 4 of card
B. Run ribbon beneath card C and turn up so as to
paste on figure 4 of card C.</p>

<p>This completes set of three. Others can be added
<i>ad infinitum</i> by ingenious children.</p>

<p>To operate (if the word be not too pretentious
a one in this connection) take hold of one of the
cards at either end and keep turning it up and down
so that first one narrow edge and then the other is
uppermost. The remaining cards should fall in a
continuous cascade.</p>

<p>The rough sides may be finished by pasting on
each a pretty paper lining cut just to fit. (See <a href="#i_066">illustration</a>.)</p>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Chinese Kite</b> (<i>Kindergarten slats</i>, <i>paper</i>, <i>glue</i>)</p>

<p>Take a firm, light paper (druggist's paper will
do). Cut two oblongs, 7 × 10 inches. Cut off all the
corners by an oblique line of three inches. Fold each
oblong lengthwise. Place the folded edges back to
back, still folded. Take two slats and place one
<i>under</i> one oblong and <i>over</i> the other, horizontally.
Do the same with the other slat, but reversing the
<i>under</i> and <i>over</i> positions. Take four strips of paper,
which should be about one inch wide. Paste two strips
over the splints, one on each side, to hold them in
place. Place a third strip from top to bottom of the
folded oblongs to hold them together. (They meanwhile
lying back to back.) Turn the oblongs over
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
place the remaining strip in corresponding position.
The result is a four-winged kite. Tie a cord
around the slats and it is finished.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Ash-Tray</b> (<i>Cigar bands</i>, <i>glass saucer</i>, <i>photographer's
paste</i>, <i>square of felt</i>)</p>

<p>For some time past children who are under the
sway of the collecting instinct have acquired from
friends or by purchase the bright colored bands that
come around cigars and then have utilized them thus:
Make an ash receiver by getting at a stationer's a
glass dish and its accompanying piece of felt. Paste
bands in pleasing positions upon the under side of
the glass. (Photographer's paste shows no discoloration.)
Meanwhile, the felt should have been thoroughly
wet, stretched to fit the under side of the
dish, and hung up to dry. When dry, paste upon the
under side of the dish and trim off neatly the projecting
corners.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Pen-Tray</b> (<i>Materials same as above, except that
stamps or embossed letter-heads are substituted
for cigar bands</i>)</p>

<p>There are many who do not wish to encourage
smoking, and to such we suggest a pleasing modification
of the above.</p>

<p>Buy the glass dish and felt above mentioned, and
instead of the bands paste upon the dish canceled
postage stamps or letter-head monograms, etc., for a
pen-tray. A smooth glass saucer and any piece of
bright-colored felt that may be in the house may of
course be used.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Scrap-Book</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
 (<i>Colored paper-muslin</i>, <i>heavy sewing silk
or worsted</i>, <i>paste</i>, <i>paste-stick</i>)</p>

<p>Cut paper-muslin of pretty colors, pink, blue or
tan, into pieces 8 × 13 inches (six pieces in all).
Fold each one over once and fit together to make a
book, the cover being of a color different from the
body of the book. Sew all together by overcasting
the back with stitches &frac12; inch apart in one direction,
and then going back in the opposite direction through
the same holes, thus securing a cross-stitch effect.
Show the child how to paste scrap-pictures neatly in
this book. He may keep it for himself or give it to
the children's ward in a hospital or to some younger
friend. A very little paste or glue will suffice; a bit
in the centre and towards the corners of a picture.</p>

<p>If the child has collected a large assortment of
cards before beginning to make the book, let him
classify them, putting together on one page animals,
on another plants, on another pictures typical of the
different seasons, etc. He may in this way suggest
a house, putting on one page kitchen furniture arranged
in some logical order; on another page the
furnishings of bedroom, etc. Pictures for this purpose
may be cut from magazine advertisements, trade
journals, etc. In the same fashion a store may be
furnished with articles for sale, the counter, scales,
and desk. This gives practice in selecting and
arranging. Good taste may be inculcated even from
such small beginnings.</p>

THE SEWING-BASKET</h2>


<p>While busy with thread and needle, the mother
may find it necessary to suggest some happy employment
for the little one who asks for something to do.
What do the contents of the sewing-basket hint?</p>


<h3>BUTTONS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Spinning Button</b> (<i>Button</i>, <i>thread</i>)</p>

<p>Show the child a button strung upon a strong
thread about 12 inches long. Then hold the thread
firmly between thumb and finger of each hand and
twirl it rapidly, drawing it suddenly taut. The button
whirls round, making a pretty spinning figure.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Stringing Buttons</b> (<i>Buttons</i>, <i>waxed thread</i>)</p>

<p>If baby is so old that he is not tempted to swallow
a pretty button, give him a strong thread waxed
at the end to make it stiff, and let him make a chain
of buttons. They may be strung according to size or
color or shape, giving practice in counting, in arrangement,
and in choice.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Buttons as Counters</b> (<i>Buttons</i>)</p>

<p>Save disused buttons of the same kind and let
the child classify into two or more sets to be used as
counters in games like checkers or go-bang. See
<a href="#Page_62">page 62</a>.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Button-Mold Wheels</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
 (<i>Molds</i>, <i>brush</i>, <i>water-color
paints</i>)</p>

<p>Give the child four wooden button-molds of the
same size and let him paint spokes upon them so that
they will be ready any time to use as wheels for a
toy wagon. Call him a little wheelwright.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Button-Mold Tops</b> (<i>Molds</i>, <i>match or toothpick</i>, <i>gilding
or paint</i>)</p>

<p>Paint or gild a button-mold and then stick through
the hole a toothpick or burnt match whittled to right
size and show the child how to spin it.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Button-Mold Counters</b> (See <a href="#Page_62">page 62</a>)</p>


<h3>SPOOLS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Furniture</b> (See <a href="#Page_15">page 15</a>)</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Tree Boxes</b> (<i>Spools</i>, <i>green paint</i>, <i>matches</i>, <i>green
paper</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>paste</i>)</p>

<p>Let the child paint an empty spool green, to be
used as a tree box. Insert a burnt match to which
has been pasted some green paper, previously fringed,
to represent foliage. The child can make a row of
such trees as a little boulevard up which he can draw
an empty match box for a carriage.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Spool Tower Target</b> (<i>A number of spools</i>, <i>ball</i>)</p>

<p>Pile a number of spools one on top of another
and let the child try to knock them down with his
ball.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Road Roller</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
 (<i>Spool</i>, <i>cord</i>, <i>toy horse</i>)</p>

<p>Tie a cord through a spool and hitch it as a road
roller to the Noah's Ark horse.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Pulley Elevator</b> (<i>Narrow cardboard box, such as a
corset box or shorter one</i>, <i>spool</i>, <i>cord</i>, <i>another
small box, either saved or made, narrow enough
to fit inside the larger one</i>, <i>skewer</i>)</p>

<p>Stand the large box on its narrow end and near
the top punch a hole on each side so that the holes are
opposite to each other. Take a spool and run through
it an axle made of a slender piece of wood like a
skewer. Then put the ends of the axle in the holes
in the box. This makes the pulley. Use the smaller
box as an elevator. Tie a string to this little box in
such a way that you can hold it up evenly. To do this
you must punch a hole in each of the opposite sides.
Then tie one end of a longer string to the middle of
the first named, and put the other end over the pulley.
Revolve the spool by pulling one end of the string
and the box will be raised.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Matching Colors</b> (<i>Spools of silk or cotton of various
colors</i>, <i>silk and cotton fabrics of different colors</i>)</p>

<p>Have a color game, asking the child to try to
match the colors on the spools with those in the fabrics.</p>


<h3>NEEDLES</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Breastpins</b> (<i>Broken needles</i>, <i>sealing wax</i>, <i>candle</i>)</p>

<p>Take a large broken needle, such that it is intact
except for the eye. Show the child how to make a
pretty pin for dolly by melting the wax a little in
the candle flame, inserting the head of the needle, and
molding into shape the bit of wax that adheres.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Threading Needles</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
 (<i>Needles</i>, <i>thread</i>)</p>

<p>If eager to do something, give the child a number
of needles with thread of white and black, and
let him thread them and put them into a cushion so
that they will be all ready for your use some morning
when you are in a hurry to sew on a button or take
a stitch in Tommy's little shirt.</p>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Thimble Biscuits</b> (See <a href="#Page_104">page 104</a>)</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Drawing Scissors</b> (<i>Scissors</i>, <i>paper</i>, <i>pencil</i>)</p>

<p>Give the child scissors and paper and let him
place the scissors on the paper and draw the outline
around them. Then tell him to cut out this outline.
Make several such and play at keeping cutlery store.
Draw scissors open at different angles and tell names
of angles; right, acute, obtuse.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Guessing Distances</b> (<i>Ruler or tape measure</i>)</p>

<p>Let the children guess the height and length of
various objects in the room. Verify by measuring
with the tape-measure. Tell them of Oliver Wendell
Holmes, the great poet, who, whenever he drove into
the country, carried a tape-measure with which to
determine the girth of any large tree he saw.</p>

<p>Let children measure the size of the panes of
glass, window-frames, etc.; have them tell how many
feet it would take to carpet the floor.</p>

<p>Tell them to put father's hat on the floor, near
the wall, and guess its height.</p>

<p>Such little exercises develop the powers of accurate
observation in a way that may prove very helpful
in an emergency.</p>

<br />
THE PAINT BOX</h2>

<p class="center">or</p>

<p class="center pb"><span class="smcap">Expression with Pencil or Brush</span></p>


<p>Let the child early be given charcoal or colored
chalks, and later the three pigments&mdash;red, blue and
yellow&mdash;wherewith to express his ideas. Allow him
some choice in the medium he uses&mdash;as pencil,
charcoal or brush&mdash;as one may be best suited to his
purpose one time, and another one at another time.</p>

<p>Encourage the child to tell a story by painting
or drawing. The earliest graphic method by which
man conveyed messages to one at a distance was
through picture-writing.</p>


<h3>LEARNING TO OBSERVE</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Painting From the Real Object</b> (<i>Paints</i>, <i>chalk or
charcoal</i>)</p>

<p>Place before the child an apple, banana or flower
of simple form and let him copy directly from the
object without previous drawing. Encourage his efforts,
however crude the results at first. It is more
educative to draw from the real object than from a
copy. Give him at first three colors only, in paints,
till he learns how to get other colors by mixing these.
For <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
this purpose point out beautiful sunsets and cloud
effects in Nature.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Life Stages of Seedling</b> (<i>Paper</i>, <i>paints</i>, <i>seedling</i>)</p>

<p>Place before the child a bean or pea. Give him
an oblong of paper 3 × 8 inches. Fold it into four
parts. In the first let him draw or paint the seed as
he sees it. Then let him plant the seed. In a day
or so let him paint a picture of the seedling, after
having grown so as to show the development of the
seed leaves. Draw two other pictures to show later
stages of growth. This gives a picture history of
the little plant and while so occupied the child is learning
to observe and note that which he sees.</p>


<h3>ACQUIRING SKILL</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Calendars</b> (<i>Water-colors</i>, <i>brush</i>, <i>paper</i>, <i>calendar pad</i>)</p>

<p>Draw circles, squares, etc., and let the child fill in
the outlines with color. A tiny calendar may be
pasted in the center and ribbons put through wherewith
to hang it up.</p>

<p>In filling in these figures show the child how to
hold the brush lightly so as to secure freedom of
stroke. Let him make long strokes beginning at the
top of the paper and moving from side to side slowly
downward, or rather as rapidly as is consistent with
neatness. Have enough water on the brush so that
the color will not dry from one long stroke before
you are able to go back and carry it on to the next
stroke. Practice making a clean, smooth surface.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Nature Pictures</b></p>

<p>Let the child fill one sheet thus with blue, a picture
of the sky. Another sheet may be covered with
green, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
a meadow. Still another sheet may have the
upper part blue and the lower green.</p>


<h3>EXPERIMENTS WITH COLOR</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Prism</b> (<i>Secure glass prism from kindergarten store
or from some candelabra you may have at home</i>)</p>

<p>Place in sunlight and let child observe colors
and the order in which they appear; always in the same
order&mdash;the cold colors at one end, the warm ones at
the other. Let the little child try to catch and hold
the lovely "light-bird."</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Pigments</b> (<i>Water-color paints</i>, <i>glasses of water</i>)</p>

<p>Dissolve a little red, yellow and blue paint in
three separate glasses. Then, by mingling these&mdash;the
primary colors&mdash;show how the secondary colors&mdash;orange,
green and violet&mdash;may be obtained.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Transparent Papers</b></p>

<p>Get at a kindergarten store the transparent
papers and isinglass used in color work. By overlapping
one upon another different hues may be obtained.
This may be done also, though less effectively,
with colored tissue papers; but these are not
so pure in tone.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Color-Top</b></p>

<p>Color tops may be procured at kindergarten stores.
With the top come paper circles, of standard colors,
with their tints and shades, giving a great variety.
These are so slit that by placing two or more on the
top according to directions and revolving the top, any
tint or hue may be mathematically produced.</p>

<p>If <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the child has made his own button-mold top,
let him cut circles of white paper and slip them over
the axis of the top. Make a dab of color here or
there on the paper with paint or chalk. Whirl
around and observe the effect. This will lead up to
a better understanding of the above-mentioned color-top
which is manufactured by the Milton Bradley Co.</p>


<h3>APPLIED ART</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Wagons and Houses</b></p>

<p>If the child has made wagons or houses of wood
or cardboard, let him paint them in broad, free strokes.
It is desirable that the little child be given work
which involves the free movement of the larger muscles
which such work demands. This may not appeal
to one as belonging under the head of art, but we
learn from Mr. Pennell that in Sicily the wagons of
the peasants are beautifully decorated with landscapes
and other pictures, and that the artists are particular
to make their names conspicuous.</p>

<p>In any case a certain artistic feeling is required
in choosing the colors and rightly applying them even
in house-painting and wagon decoration. And meanwhile
the child is learning how to wield his instruments.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Place Cards</b></p>

<p>Take a clover leaf and practice painting from it
until able to make a copy good enough to paint upon
a place card for the table. If the drawing be correct,
just a flat wash of color will do for the painting
at first.</p>

<p>An autumn leaf will do for a Thanksgiving card.</p>

<p>See <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">Festival Occasions</a> for other ideas.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Tops</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
</p>

<p>If a button-mold top has been made, it may be
painted in concentric rings or the entire surface may
be neatly colored.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Match-Safe</b></p>

<p>This has been described upon <a href="#Page_34">page 34</a>.</p>

<p>Let child draw or paint design for toy rug he
is making for doll-house. He may make an oblong
of one color, and at each end draw lines across, which
are to be woven in another color. There may be
one line at each end, or two, or three, etc. The arrangement
of these lines and their distance apart allow
much scope for taste and judgment.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Designs for Wall-Papers, Oilcloths, Etc.</b> (<i>Parquetry
papers</i>, <i>paste</i>, <i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p>1. Have child observe oilcloth designs and then
with kindergarten parquetry papers try to make similar
ones for doll-house.</p>

<p>2. Having made pasted designs, let him copy
same in water-colors.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Design for Stained Glass Window</b> (<i>Transparent
paper</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>white paper</i>, <i>paste</i>)</p>

<p>Cut a circle out of the white paper. Fold it once,
which gives a half-circle; fold again, which gives a
quarter-circle. Holding it folded, cut several ellipses,
triangles, etc., into the folded edges. Open out and
you have framework of a rose-window. On the back
of this paste a piece of transparent paper (see <a href="#Page_75">page
75</a>), red or green or yellow, and let the light shine
through. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Hang in window for transparency. Suitable
for Easter gift. Vary by cutting like cathedral windows.

<h3>PICTURE-STORY</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Chased by a Goose</b> (<i>Pencil</i>, <i>paper</i>)</p>

<p>Once some boys lived in a house (make a dot)
surrounded by a strong fence (draw circle round the
dot). A short distance off was a large pond (an oval,
a little below and to the right of the circle). One
day the boys ran down to the pond (draw curved
line from house to pond) and began to splash in the
water and to throw it at each other (a number of
oblique lines from right hand end of pond). Some
distance off lived some Indians in two wigwams (two
oblique lines meeting at the top and next to them a
similar pair, like two tents, just below the pond).
When the Indians saw the boys throwing the water
out <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
they began to chase the boys, running up a zigzag
path (from each tent draw an oblique line to the right
for a short distance and then turn to the left till it
meets the pond). The boys ran as fast as they could
up a winding path parallel to the one they ran down
(draw curving line parallel to first one), and then ran
to the left partly around the fence surrounding the
house. They had to run around the barn, too (an
oblique line to the left and then another to the
right till it meets the circle again), and when they
looked behind them they found they had been chased
by a goose!!!</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i_079" name="i_079"></a>
<img src="images/i_079.jpg" alt="i_079" />

<p class="caption">Chased by a Goose.</p>

</div>


<p>A little practice will make this easy for the story
teller. The original dot and circle form the head and
eye of the goose. The curving path is the neck. The
water splashing out makes the tail feathers. The
wigwams and the zigzag path form the legs and feet,
and the path around the barn makes the bill.</p>

DOLLS AND DOLL-HOUSES</h2>


<p>What little girl does not love a doll? The more
variety in their size and style the better pleased is
she. Below are a number of suggestions for simple
home-made dollies that may be prepared as a birthday
or other surprise by older brothers or sisters.</p>


<h3>A FEW DOLLS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>1.</b> <b>Clay-Pipe Doll</b></p>

<p>Ink in the eyes, nose and mouth on the back of
the bowl of a pipe; dress in calico gown and apron,
and put on a sunbonnet to conceal the top of the
pipe.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>2.</b> <b>Clothespin Doll</b></p>

<p>Ink features upon the head of the clothespin and
clothe as either boy or girl.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>3.</b> <b>Wishbone Doll</b> (<i>Wishbone</i>, <i>sealing-wax</i>, <i>material
for trousers</i>)</p>

<p>Clothe the two limbs in trousers and ink in the
features upon the flat joining bone. Feet may be made
of sealing wax melted, pressed into shape and attached
while still warm.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>4.</b> <b>Peanut Doll</b> (<i>Peanuts</i>, <i>sewing-silk</i>, <i>glue</i>, <i>thread
and needle</i>, <i>silk for dress</i>)</p>

<p>Make <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
into Chinese doll. Take one peanut and ink
in the features, making the eyes slanting. Glue on
a queue of braided silk. String together several peanuts
to make the body. To the upper one add on
each side one or two as arms and string several together
to make legs. Dress in wide-sleeved jacket
and wide-legged trousers of Oriental design.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>5.</b> <b>Yarn Doll</b> (<i>Skein of white cotton yarn</i>)</p>

<p>Cut the skein into lengths of 12 inches. Double
the skein over in the middle and tie a string tight
around about two inches from the top, forming a neck
and so making the head. Tie another string further
down for a waist line, but leave out a few threads on
each side, of which to make two arms. Tie these
near the ends to indicate wrists. Before tying the
wrists cut the threads to right lengths for arms. The
features may be put in with ink.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>6.</b> <b>Cork Doll</b> (<i>16 or more corks saved from olive bottles,
etc.</i>, <i>smooth wire or hairpins&mdash;three in number</i>)</p>

<p>String several corks upon the wire or hairpin for
head and body. Through the second cork from the top
run a hairpin sideways for arms, and fasten two corks
upon each projecting end, cutting off any of the wire
that may extend beyond the cork. Through the lower
cork of the body run another hairpin and fasten two
corks upon it for legs. Turn the end corks sideways
to suggest feet. Dress the doll as desired.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>7.</b> <b>Paper Doll</b> (<i>Fashion papers and catalogues</i>, <i>scissors</i>,
<i>paint</i>, <i>paste</i>)</p>

<p>Most little girls find great pleasure in making their
own paper dollies and the garments therefor. Fashion
papers <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and catalogues afford many dolls for cutting
out, and tissue paper, crinkled paper, the lace paper
found in candy boxes, etc., form the raw material for
beautiful Parisian gowns.</p>

<p>Dolls may of course be cut out of white paper and
beautiful countenances painted upon them, or holes
may be cut in the head for eyes, nose and mouth.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>8.</b> <b>Rag Doll</b> (<i>White cotton cloth</i>, <i>cotton batting</i>,
<i>paints</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>needle</i>, <i>thread</i>, <i>water-color paints
or blueing and red ink</i>, <i>raveled rope</i>, <i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p>Cut a large newspaper pattern of a doll. Then
double the cloth, pin the pattern upon it and cut the
two sides for the doll. Run neatly around with close
stitches, beginning at the neck, and when nearly finished
turn inside out, stuff with the cotton batting, and
sew up the head. Paint in the features or use blueing
for eyes and red ink for mouth and cheeks. Ravelings
of rope will make silky hair, and fingers may be indicated
by stitches.</p>


<h3>SOME DOLL-HOUSES</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>1.</b> <b>Cigar-Box House</b> (<i>Small cigar-box</i>, <i>paste</i>, <i>scissors</i>,
<i>pictures</i>, <i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p>A cigar-box, small as it is, will give great delight
to a child who is aided in furnishing a little room.
Stand the box up on the long side. Paper with wall
paper of a small design. Then furnish with things
made by the child himself; pictures cut from catalogues,
and other accessories as described below.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>2.</b> <b>Pasteboard-Box House</b> (<i>Four pasteboard boxes</i>,
<i>glue</i>, <i>paint</i>)</p>

<p>Select <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
four strong pasteboard boxes of uniform
size. Boxes such as the "Martha Washington Candles"
are packed in will do. They measure 7 × 11
inches. Lay aside the covers and remove any paper
which may be attached to the inside of the box.
Spread a thick paste of Spaulding's glue or furniture
glue over the surface of one side of a box. Fit one
side of a second to this glued surface and put aside
to dry. The third and fourth boxes are treated in the
same manner. When securely glued in pairs place
the boxes with open sides facing you. Cover upper
outside surface of one pair of boxes with a thick coating
of glue and set the second pair on top of these in
the same position.</p>

<p>Now, one has a pasteboard house of four rooms&mdash;two
upstairs and two downstairs. When securely
fastened together cut in the partition separating the
two upper rooms a door four inches high and three
wide. Two windows measuring 3 × 4 inches, two
inches from floor, may be cut in the back of the house.
The same treatment may be given the rooms downstairs.
One may arrange a kitchen and dining-room
downstairs and a parlor and bedroom upstairs.</p>

<p>Oil paints, such as are used in painting furniture,
which come already mixed in small cans, may be used
for painting the exterior of the house.</p>

<p>In using this paint it is well to remember always
to put sufficient paint on the brush to cover the
entire surface of the wall of the house, from edge to
edge, without lifting the brush. A strict observance
of this rule insures a neatly painted surface. If desired,
one may use yellow, green, or any light color
for the interior.</p>

<p>Remnants of cartridge paper or paper decorated
in small designs can often be obtained of paper-hangers
for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
a small sum. It may be fastened to the
floor to serve as a large rug.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>3.</b> <b>Soap-Box House</b> (<i>Three wooden soap-boxes</i>, <i>nails</i>,
<i>saw</i>, <i>paint</i>)</p>

<p>Take three soap-boxes, wooden. Remove the
covers from two and place one upon the other to make
a two-story house. Put in partitions thus: Take a
thin piece of board (from a smaller box), saw to
needed height and depth and nail it in place by driving
nails from above, below or the side, as the case
may require. A stiff piece of cardboard (taken from
a large box) may be made to serve as partition. If
cut to the right size the pressure from top and bottom
will hold in place.</p>

<p>By taking <i>two small</i> boxes for the upper floor
instead of one large one the space which would be
naturally left between can be made into a hallway.
Stairs may then be made of stiff cardboard, folded
into steps, with a strip of obliquely-cut paper pasted
along the edges of the steps to keep them in place.</p>

<p>If windows and doorways are desired they must
be cut or sawed in after being drawn where desired
in pencil.</p>

<p>The third box is for the gable roof. It is to be
placed on top of the upper floor so that its sides slant
for the roof. Put in place and then mark off all that
needs to be sawed away. When ready to be fixed
permanently put in place and nail through.</p>

<p>The furnishing of the little house gives much
scope for ingenuity and invention as well as for the
exercise of good sense and good taste.</p>

<p>The exterior of the house can be painted with
house paint, and this gives occasion for the broad use
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the larger muscles, and physiologists tell us that the
little child should exercise the larger muscles and
nerves while the finer ones are still undeveloped.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Tiling</b> (<i>Corrugated packing cardboard</i>, <i>tacks</i>, <i>hammer</i>)</p>

<p>The roof may be given a tiled effect by covering
with corrugated packing cardboard saved from packages.
Tack this on.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Papering</b></p>

<p>1. Paper with wall-paper. Scraps of it may be
saved when the home is being papered.</p>

<p>2. Oil-cloth effects may be obtained by pasting
on floors or walls designs made with the kindergarten
parquetry papers. (See <a href="#Page_168">page 168</a>.)</p>

<p>3. Friezes may be made in the same way by using
circles and squares in rows, alternately or successively.</p>


<h3>DOLL FURNITURE</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>1.</b> <b>Cork.</b> (See <a href="#Page_37">page 37</a>.)</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>2.</b> <b>Block</b> (<i>Blocks of wood or kindergarten blocks,
cubes and oblongs</i>)</p>

<p>Glue these blocks together, three cubes making
a little chair, and cubes and oblongs making a bed or
sofa. Get the carpenter to saw a number of blocks
of different shapes and sizes and let the child use his
invention in putting them together. The furniture
may be painted or gilded.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>3.</b> <b>Paper or Cardboard</b></p>

<p>Take a piece of paper 1 × 2 inches. Fold crosswise.
Make <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
a dot &frac14; inch from the folded edge and
&#8539; inch from right hand edge. Make dot &frac14; inch from
fold and &#8539; inch from left hand edge. From open
edges opposite fold make two parallel cuts to these
dots. These cuts make the four legs. When opened
out a table is seen with two extensions for drop-leaf.
Cut one of these extensions off and a chair is made.
If the original paper is longer and wider it can be
made into a bed, what were the leaves of the table being
bent up into the head and foot of the bed. An ingenious
child can vary and elaborate this furniture <i>ad
infinitum</i>. The backs can be cut into fancy form and
arms given to chairs and sofa.</p>

<p>Use one of these paper chairs for a model, place
on cardboard and draw around the outline and so
obtain a stiffer bit of furniture. Rockers can be drawn,
added to the feet, and cut out, thus making a rocking
chair.</p>


<h3>SPECIAL ARTICLES OF FURNITURE</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Pictures and Clocks</b> (<i>Trade journals</i>, <i>scissors</i>)</p>

<p>Cut from trade journals and attach to walls.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Lamp</b> (<i>Twist spool</i>, <i>toothpick</i>, <i>half egg-shell</i>, <i>wax</i>)</p>

<p>Paste a bit of paper on top and bottom of twist
spool. Through this stick a toothpick, which the
paper should hold firmly. Upon the top of the toothpick
fasten a half egg-shell for a globe with bit of
wax or glue.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Stove</b> (<i>Cardboard</i>, <i>black ink or paint</i>)</p>

<p>Make oblong box of cardboard. Turn upside
down and cut openings for top of stove. Make a
small hole in the back of the stove and insert in it a
piece <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of paper rolled into a stove-pipe and pasted.
Cut openings in front for the grate and ovens, leaving
a door for the latter. Ink or paint black.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Windows</b> (<i>Thin white paper</i>, <i>oil</i>, <i>glue</i>)</p>

<p>Brush a piece of white paper over with ordinary
machine oil, or olive oil, or dip it in the oil and when
dry glue in for windows, telling the children that not
very long ago that was the only way in which light
was admitted to many houses before glass became so
common.</p>

<p>Isinglass may also be put in for windows.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Doll's Bedstead</b> (<i>Cigar-box</i>, <i>glue</i>, <i>gilt-headed tacks</i>)</p>

<p>Saw the <i>cover</i> of box into two pieces, one for the
head and one for the foot. Fasten in place to the box
with the decorative tacks. Legs may be attached if
desired.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Curtains</b> (<i>Cheesecloth or lace</i>, <i>needle</i>, <i>thread</i>)</p>

<p>Cut small squares of cheesecloth and let the child
hem and put in windows for curtains. Do not insist
on very fine sewing for beginners. Curtains may be
edged with lace, or the entire curtain may be made
of lace, tacked or glued to inside of window.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Telephone</b> (<i>Two spools</i>, <i>nail</i>, <i>tin mucilage top</i>, <i>string</i>,
<i>small flat block</i>)</p>

<p>Take a flat piece of wood about two inches square.
Glue to it the flat end of small spool. That is the
'phone. Another spool is the receiver hanging, when
not in use, upon a nail driven into the wood. The
mucilage top has the slot into which to drop the imaginary
nickel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<h3>MISCELLANEOUS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Grocery Store</b> (<i>Wooden soap-box</i>, <i>small cardboard
box</i>, <i>scales</i>, <i>toy barrels</i>, <i>tiny pill boxes</i>, <i>sand</i>,
<i>pebbles</i>, <i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p>A small wooden box makes the store. A smaller
cardboard box turned upside down will make the
counter, or small pieces of wood can be nailed together
by the little amateur carpenter. Buy toy scales
or make some as described below. Small barrels can
be obtained at toy store or little bottles and boxes can
be filled with small quantities of tea and sugar, with
tiny bags of pebbles for potatoes, apples, etc. Cranberries
make acceptable play apples. Corn and nuts also
will find places. Tacks can be hammered in on which
to hang tiny brooms, and by hammering in two long
nails and laying a narrow board upon them a shelf
can be made for the canned vegetables. Let the
children make their own brown paper bags, looking at
a real one for a model.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Scales</b> (<i>Two small square cardboard boxes, made or
bought</i>, <i>twine</i>, <i>skewer or other slender stick of
wood or metal</i>)</p>

<p>In each of the four sides of a box make a small
hole near the top. Take two pieces of twine each four
times the width of the box. Tie one of these through
two opposite holes of the box and the other piece
through the two other holes, being sure that the
strings when tied are of equal length. These two
strings cross each other. In the middle, exactly where
they cross, tie one end of a string three inches long.
Raise the box by this string and it should hang exactly
true. Arrange the other box in the same way.</p>

<p>Now <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
take the skewer and exactly in the <i>middle</i>
tie a string of three inches. To the ends of the stick
tie the ends of the twine already tied to the boxes.
Raise the skewer by this string and the boxes should
hang evenly, like scales. If they do not, slide one or
the other back and forth until they do balance.</p>

<p>Use in the toy grocery store. Playing store is
always a fine opportunity for indicating lessons of
honesty in business. Train the child to give fair
weight and measure, even in play.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Merry-Go-Round for Dolls</b> (<i>Cardboard</i>, <i>large ribbon
spool</i>, <i>stiff paper or kindergarten folding
paper</i>, <i>slender pencil</i>, <i>tiny flag</i>)</p>

<p>Cut two circles of cardboard, one five inches in
diameter; the other, ten to twelve. Using the smaller
one as a base, stand on it a large ribbon spool (spool
around which baby ribbon comes). Glue the large circle
to the other end of the spool, parallel to the other
lower circle. Make a hole in each circle. Run a slender
pencil through the upper cardboard, then through
the spool, and then through the lower circle, making
an axis round which the spool may revolve, carrying
with it the upper circle.</p>

<p>On the upper circle paste alternately animals cut
from paper or cardboard, and benches also cut from
cardboard. Elegance may be added by gilding the
spool and letting a tiny flag float from the point of the
pencil. Cut out paper dolls for a ride.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Dolls' Park</b> (<i>Starch-box</i>, <i>earth</i>, <i>moss</i>, <i>twigs</i>, <i>tiny
mirror</i>, <i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p>Fill the box with earth and sand for a foundation,
and then with moss, twigs, elder-berry sprigs,
etc., <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
fill in the fairy-like details. A toy swan or boat
adds to the reality.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Rugs for Doll-House</b></p>

<p>1. Make the loom by taking a slate and knocking
out the slate so as to leave the frame intact. Hammer
a row of small nails half an inch apart along the
two narrow sides. Then make the warp by stringing
strong cord back and forth across the nails. Tie first
around one corner nail; carry <i>to</i> and <i>around</i> the two
nails opposite, then back and around the next two, and
so back and forth till it is all strung. The rows of
cord should be parallel.</p>

<p>2. Instead of a slate, looms of various sizes may
be roughly made of four narrow pieces of wood measured,
sawed, and nailed together at the corners. A
curtain slat could be so used, or wooden boxes will
furnish raw material for such. A loom 4 × 6 inches
is a good size for a beginner.</p>

<p>For woof, use coarse worsted or ribbon to begin
with, or colored cheesecloth torn into narrow strips.</p>

<p>Use the fingers at first, later a bodkin, weaving
under one cord of the warp and over one, back and
forth, till a tiny rug is made. Fasten ends by weaving
in and out a short distance into body of rug. At
first make rug all of one color, or a rag-carpet effect
can be obtained by tying into a long string worsteds
of various colors. If a plain color is used a border
can be made by running in a strand or so of a different
color.</p>

<p>Let the child employ his artistic and creative
abilities in making designs for the rug with paints or
crayons. Draw an oblong of one color with stripes
across the ends, one, two or three in number, at different
distances apart. Variety can be secured by
taking <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
up two threads at a time or running under <i>one</i>
and over <i>two</i>, etc. Warn the child not to draw the
threads too closely or the rug will have the shape of
an hour-glass when finished.</p>

<p>A washcloth can be made thus by weaving it of
narrow pieces of cheesecloth.</p>

<p>Take the rug or cloth off the loom by raising
carefully over the nails.</p>

<p>3. Another simple kind of loom is made by taking
a piece of cardboard measuring 6 × 8 inches.
Draw a row of eight dots half an inch apart. Opposite
these, and six inches away, draw another row.
With strong cord sew through these a set of straight
stitches, six inches long and half an inch apart. This
makes the warp. Run the worsted woof under and
over these cords as in any weaving, and tear the cardboard
away when finished.</p>

PLAYS AND GAMES</h2>


<p>In playing games children learn lessons of fair
play, of mutual forbearance and patience, and of
letting a playfellow "have a chance," which they learn
in no other way. Apart from the important bodily
exercise and development gained in the active physical
games, the demand upon mental and moral qualities
is of immeasurable value.</p>

<p>A child should never be permitted to cheat at a
game, even "in fun." A game loses significance as a
game when one person does not "play fair." The
child to whom even the thought of so doing is impossible
begins the race of life with an immense advantage,
for we believe that the foundation for all real
life is <i>character</i>.</p>

<p>We give a few games which have been tried with
success either in the home, the kindergarten, or the
playground. Some of these plays require materials;
others do not. In some cases instructions are given
for making the required materials.</p>


<h3>TAG GAMES</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Circle Tag</b></p>

<p>One person stands in the center of a ring of children
and each one in the ring holds out his right
hand. The one in the middle tags one of the hands
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the owner immediately gives chase till he catches
the pursued.</p>

<p>Vary by having both tagged and tagger skip,
hop, etc., instead of run.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Racing Tag</b></p>

<p>Players form circle. One goes outside the ring
and runs or walks around, suddenly quietly touching
another player, who immediately races with him, going
around the ring in opposite direction.</p>

<p>Vary by having contestants bow three times as
they pass each other.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Wood, Iron or Paper Tag</b></p>

<p>One child chases another who touches for goal
anything made of wood, or iron, or paper, etc., as has
been decided upon beforehand. If the pursued is
caught before he succeeds in touching such object,
he becomes "it." The goal may be a wooden stick
or tree, or an iron rake, or a paper book, etc.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Japanese Tag</b></p>

<p>Form a long line of children, one following
closely behind another in a march or run. One
child outside the line is "it." He tries to tag some
one in the line. The leader endeavors to prevent this
by twisting his file rapidly in and out in a curving
line, and, by so throwing out his arms, as to protect the
threatened one, as the line twists and turns with him.
If one is tagged, the leader becomes "it." The leader
and his train of children must of course be alert in
mind and active in body.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Cross-Tag</b></p>

<p>Of a group of children the one who is "it" chases
any <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
one he chooses to begin with, but if another child
runs in between the chased and the chaser, the chaser
must follow the one who has thus run in between. If
he shows signs of fatigue a third child may run across
between the two, etc., he then being chased until the
tagger succeeds in catching some one, who in turn becomes
"it."</p>


<h3>RACES</h3>

<p>Allied to the tag games are the racing games, of
which we give only two.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Potato Race</b> (<i>Twelve potatoes</i>, <i>two tablespoons</i>)</p>

<p>Place six potatoes in a row about three feet apart.
Place six others in a parallel row some distance away.
Give two players each a spoon, and at a signal they
start to race. Each player runs up his row, picking
up the potatoes, one by one, carrying each in turn to
a given point, then coming back for another potato,
till all are thus carried. The left hand must not assist.
The one who first gets his potatoes safely to the spot
decided upon wins.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Clothespin Race</b> (<i>Handful of clothespins</i>)</p>

<p>Arrange the children in two rows, equal in number.
Give the first child a handful of clothespins, laid
straight. At a signal he passes them down the line.
If one is dropped it must be picked up by the one
dropping it and put as before with the others and then
passed on. Reaching the end of the line, they are at
once passed back again to the starting point. The side
wins which first get back all the pins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<h3>AIMING GAMES WITH BEAN-BAGS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Kinds of Bags</b> (1. <i>Ticking or strong calico</i>, <i>strong
thread</i>, <i>needle</i>, <i>baking-beans</i>. 2. <i>Felt</i>, <i>sewing
silk</i>)</p>

<p>1. Make a strong bag of bright colored material,
6 × 8 inches in size. Fill with the ordinary baking-beans
and overhand the top.</p>

<p>2. Take a piece of felt or any pretty strong material
which will bear the wear and tear of the game.
Cut into two circles 5 or 6 inches in diameter. Sew
together on the wrong side, with a seam of one fourth
inch. Then cut in the center a small circle half an
inch in diameter. Turn the odd-shaped bag inside
out, fill with beans and overhand the small circular
opening with close stitches of silk. These bags can
be more easily caught than balls by little hands.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Kinds of Games</b></p>

<p>Children usually hand down familiar games from
one generation to another. Here are a few:</p>

<p>1. Children stand in a circle with one in the center
who throws the bag to each in turn all around the
ring, or else tries to catch some one napping by throwing
it unexpectedly.</p>

<p>2. Vary by having children stand in a row and
the leader throws to each in turn. Or children stand
in opposite rows and every one in one line has a bag
which all throw in unison to the child opposite. These
in turn throw back in perfect rythm.</p>

<p>3. Vary again by tossing into the air in unison.
The accompaniment of music is always a thing to
be desired in such rythmic games.</p>

<p>4. One <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
child stands in center of ring and tries
to catch the bag as it is tossed across to some one on
the other side of the ring.</p>


<h3>AIMING GAMES WITH BALLS</h3>

<p>The games just described may be played with
balls as well as with bean-bags, and thus require more
co-ordination on the part of the child's muscles. We
give a few other games in addition.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Counting-Ball</b></p>

<p>Let one child bounce the ball, striking it from
above with the palm of his hand and counting one,
two, etc., until he fails to hit it, when another child
takes a turn.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Guess-Ball</b></p>

<p>A row of players number off from one end 1, 2,
3, 4, etc. The last number steps in front of the row
a distance such as may be needed to secure certainty
of aim and touch on the part of those who throw the
ball. The player in front stands with his back to the
others. Those in the row now begin to pass the ball
sideways from one to the other. The player in front
having counted a given number, the one who happens
to hold the ball at the time must at once throw it at
the player in front. If struck, the latter turns quickly
and tries to judge from the attitudes of the various
players which one threw the ball. If he is right,
places are exchanged. If he guesses wrong, the game
continues as before.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Cup and Ball</b> (<i>Cardboard</i>, <i>worsted</i>, <i>funnel</i>)</p>

<p>Make the ball by cutting from cardboard two
circles <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
about two inches in diameter. Inside the large
circles draw smaller ones about one-half inch in diameter.
Cut the smaller circles entirely out, thus leaving
a hole in the middle of each large circle. Keep these
two large circles together. Now, with a needle, wind
worsted round and round through the opening in the
two circles until it is completely filled, so that the
needle cannot be pushed through. Hold in the left
hand, and with sharp pointed scissors cut the worsted
at the edge of the circles, spread the circles a little
apart, and tie a strong thread firmly around the worsted
between the two cardboard circles. Then tear the
cardboard circles away and a pretty ball remains. Tie
this ball, with a string twelve inches long, to a kitchen
funnel, and let the child try to catch the ball in the
funnel.</p>


<h3>AIMING GAMES&mdash;MISCELLANEOUS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Ring-Toss</b> (<i>Small wooden box</i>, <i>broom-handle or
dowel</i>, <i>nail or glue</i>, <i>embroidery rings or hoops of
small keg</i>)</p>

<p>Saw a foot from a broom-handle or dowel (a
child's broom will best serve the purpose). Glue or
nail this to a box. Let the child practice tossing over
this post rings taken from a small keg; or embroidery
rings may be used. These may be wound around with
bright colored strips of lining or with ribbon. The
rings should be graduated in size.</p>


<p class="hang2"><a name="Grace-Hoops" id="Grace-Hoops"></a><b>Grace-Hoops</b> (<i>Basket reeds</i>, <i>raffia</i>)</p>

<p>Make a wand of three or four basket reeds cut
into two foot lengths. Wind these more or less
loosely with string, just so as to hold them together.
Then wind around and around closely and smoothly
with a strand of raffia so as to bind firmly together.
If <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
held smoothly, several strands of raffia may be used
at one time. If reeds are not to be had lilac branches
may be used instead. The result should be a wand
firm and stiff.</p>

<p>Make the hoops by soaking the reeds first in
water for an hour to make flexible. They should be
cut into lengths of about 2&frac12; feet. Curve several into
a hoop and tie. Then wind smoothly and firmly with
the raffia. The ends of the latter may be disposed of
by threading upon a large needle and running it a
short distance in and out of the part already wound.</p>

<p>Two wands and one hoop are required for each
player. One tosses a ring from her two wands to her
opponent, who must catch it upon her own wands.</p>

<p>This once popular game cultivates both alertness
and grace.</p>

<p>In the kindergarten the children use wand and
ring in playing "knights." One child holds the ring
while the little knight gallops around the circle on
an imaginary steed and tries to capture the ring on
his lance (wand), as at an old-time tournament.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Croquet with Peas</b> (<i>Peas</i>, <i>hairpins or double-headed
tacks</i>, <i>nail or match</i>, <i>toothpick</i>, <i>cork</i>, <i>cover of
starch-box</i>)</p>

<p>Bend hairpins into shape or use double-headed
tacks as wickets. Insert into the cover of a wooden
starch-box for ground. For a stake use a nail or a
painted match-stick. Sharpen this to a point and
insert it in a hole previously made by hammering in
a nail. Make mallets by inserting matches or toothpicks
into heads made of small pieces of cork. Use
peas for balls.</p>

<p>Put the whole outfit in a box and give to little
sister for her doll's birthday.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Egg-Shell Game</b> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
(<i>Egg-shell</i>, <i>long table</i>, <i>four tumblers</i>)</p>

<p>Blow an egg-shell and paint with some college
colors as a foot-ball. Take four tumblers and place
two at one end of a long table for goals and two at
the opposite end for goals, the two which make a pair
being four inches apart. Divide the party into two
competing groups. Those on one side must try to
blow the shell between the tumblers of their opponents.
These must try to defend their end of the table and at
the same time try to blow the shell between the tumblers
of their opponents. This makes a merry game
for young people.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Cherry-Stone Game</b> (<i>Save and dry a dozen or more
cherry-stones</i>)</p>

<p>Scatter the stones lightly on the table. They will
fall so that some lie closely together, others far apart.
The first player selects any two stones and draws his
finger between them so that he touches neither. If
he succeeds thus far he must then try to snap one
(with thumb and middle finger) so that it strikes the
other. If this succeeds also the two stones belong to
him and he has another turn, continuing until he either
touches a stone in trying to draw a finger between two
or fails to make one of the two hit the other. The
second player will not fare so well, because the remaining
pairs will lie closer together than those first
chosen, so that great care will be needed in drawing
the finger between two. Sometimes it is necessary
to use the little finger. At the end the player having
most stones wins the game. The stones may be dyed
or painted if desired. The game suggests tiddledy-winks
and crokinole.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Donkey Game</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
 (<i>Picture of a donkey, minus a tail, and
one dozen separate tails. These may be bought
in large sheets for ten cents, but may be cut out
of paper if drawn first by skilful hands</i>)</p>

<p>Pin the picture to the wall in some spot where it
will not deface it. Give each player a tail with a pin
sticking through it. Blindfold him. Turn him around
three times and send him in the direction of the
picture to pin the tail on the donkey. The one who
succeeds in fastening a tail nearest to the proper place
wins the game.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Blowing Out the Candle</b> (<i>Candle in candlestick</i>)</p>

<p>Place a candle on the table. Blindfold a player,
turn him around three times about six feet from the
candle. Then let him try to find his way towards it
and blow it out. He may have three trials.</p>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS PLAYS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>The Countess of the Huggermuggers</b> (<i>Two candles
in candlesticks</i>)</p>

<p>Give two players each a candle. They take places
about eight feet apart. Then each takes a step forward
at the same time and makes a solemn bow without
smiling; then another step and bow; and then a third.
Then one says solemnly, "The Countess of the Huggermuggers
is dead." The other one rejoins, "I am very
sorry to hear it." The first one replies, "So am I."
Then each takes three steps backward, with a bow
each time, and all without a smile. Whoever smiles
must give up his place to another player.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Rope and Sandbag</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
 (<i>Rope ten feet long, with handle
at one end which may be made by knotting the
rope, and a sandbag or other weight at the other.
Sandbag may be made of strong goods sewed into
a bag and filled with sand. In a kindergarten a
weight has been improvised out of a child's
rubber shoe</i>)</p>

<p>Some one stands in the center of a circle of children
and swings the rope so that the weight just
grazes the ground. The children must be sufficiently
attentive and agile to evade the rope by jumping over
it as it passes them. Do not begin until the rope has
acquired momentum enough to move with a degree of
regularity.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Omnibus Swing</b> (<i>Strong rope or chain</i>, <i>staples</i>, <i>soapbox</i>,
<i>wooden plank</i>, <i>nails</i>)</p>

<p>If fortunate enough to have a barn or summer-house,
or a playroom with a strong beam in the roof
or ceiling, place a pair of strong staples in the beam
(hammock hooks would serve the same purpose) a
few <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
inches apart. Six feet from these place <i>another
pair</i> of staples in the beam. From each pair of staples
or hooks suspend a loop of rope so that it comes about
one foot from the floor.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i_102" name="i_102"></a>
<img src="images/i_102.jpg" alt="i_102" />

<p class="caption">Omnibus Swing.</p>

</div>



<p>Take a plank about eight feet long and one foot
wide and cut four notches in it, two on each side,
about six inches from the ends. Place the plank so
that it hangs held by the two ropes, which slip into
the notches in the plank, the notches keeping the ropes
in place. Upon this several children can swing back
and forth lengthwise, and so play at rowing, riding,
trolleying, etc., as imagination dictates. If a soapbox
be nailed at one end the baby may be put into this
for a safe ride.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Anagrams</b> (<i>Tinted Bristol board</i>, <i>black ink or paint</i>,
<i>heavy pen or brush</i>)</p>

<p>Cut the Bristol board into 1-inch squares and let
the child paint or draw upon these squares the letters
of the alphabet, one letter to each square. There
should be at least a dozen of each letter and many
more A's, E's and S's, as these letters occur frequently
in English words. Two games may be played with
these letters as follows:</p>

<p>1. Give the child the four or five letters that compose
a word and let him try to put them together in
the right way as: <i>H-s-e-r-o</i> (<i>Horse</i>).</p>

<p>2. Several players are needed for this game. The
cards must be placed upside down in a box so that the
letters are not seen. Each player takes a letter in
turn, the first time round, and places it in the centre
of the table. At the second time round, each, as he
takes a square from the box, tries to form a word
with it, either by using a letter from the central pool
or by taking away an opponent's word. If he takes
from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
an opponent he must take an entire word. As
he forms a word he places it before himself, the aim
being to get five or ten words before any opponent
does. If he can form no word he puts his letter in the
pool. The number of words making the game must
be agreed upon beforehand. For example: In the pool
are placed in turn the letters <i>g, b, f, t</i>. Player I, continuing,
draws from the box the letter <i>a</i> and with the
letters in the pool can form <i>bat</i>, which he places in
front of him, leaving <i>g</i> and <i>f</i> in the pool. Player II
draws an <i>l</i>, and as he can form no word, he puts it in
the pool. Player III draws an <i>e</i> and takes away the
<i>bat</i> of No. I, turning it into <i>beat</i>. Player II draws an
<i>o</i>, which with the <i>g</i> from the pool, he turns into <i>go</i>.
Player I then draws again, and so the game continues
until one player has, we will say, five words, the number
agreed upon, and so wins.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Weighing Honey</b></p>

<p>One child crouches, clasping his hands beneath
his knees tightly. Two older persons then take the
handles of the honey-jar (the child's arms) and swing
him back and forth, counting one, two, three, etc.,
with each swing until the hands give way. The number
of counts tells the number of pounds in the jar.</p>


<h3>SUGGESTIONS FOR CHILDREN'S PARTIES</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Peanut Party</b> (<i>Several quarts of peanuts, and a pretty
little bag measuring 6 × 8 inches for each guest</i>)</p>

<p>Before the little guests arrive, hide the peanuts
in corners, under cushions, and in all possible hiding-places,
singly, or two or three together. At a signal
all of the children begin to search for the peanuts.
The <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
one finding the most wins. Give a reward of a
peanut doll. (See <a href="#Page_80">page 80</a>.)</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In no such games of competition is it a good plan
to have expensive prizes. That plan ministers to a
weakness inherent perhaps in human nature, but one
to be discouraged&mdash;the desire to win, not for the sake
of success, but for the sake of the prize. The giving
of a valuable prize engenders feelings of envy and
caters too much to the gambling instinct. It tends to
destroy the spirit of fun and play which is the real
object of a social gathering.</p>

<p>A part of such an entertainment would appropriately
be the making of peanut taffy or of peanut
animals. (See <a href="#Page_23">page 23</a>.)</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Spider-Web Party</b> (<i>Balls of pretty twine, one color
for each guest</i>)</p>

<p>Take a ball of twine and to the end attach a card
bearing the name of one guest. Then unwind it, twisting
it around different articles of furniture, chairs,
table-legs, door-knob, chandelier, etc., till the thread
is judged to be long enough. Then cut, and to this
end tie some trifling gift. Arrange in this way one
ball and gift for each child expected. When the time
for playing the game arrives, give to each child the
card bearing his name, to which twine is attached. At
the signal for beginning, each one follows up his line,
unwinding and disentangling it as he goes along, till
the end of the cord bearing the gift is reached. As
each little visitor receives something, there is no unwholesome
spirit of rivalry.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Thimble-Biscuit Party</b> (<i>Dough</i>, <i>silver thimbles</i>)</p>

<p>While making biscuits for supper give the little
child a silver thimble to use as a biscuit cutter, first
rolling <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the dough to a thickness one-third the height of
the thimble. When he has made a good array put
them into the oven. They will bake quickly and to
the child will seem to surpass the best cake made.</p>

<p>Invite a group of little children to a thimble-biscuit
party. A dough of flour, water or milk, a little
salt and baking powder will be sufficient and the
little workers will be very happy making the wee biscuits.
Only silver thimbles should be used.</p>

<p>While the biscuits are baking a few games, notably
"Hide the Thimble," will pass the time. Served
with a little jam or milk they will make a delicious
repast, with dolls and Teddy Bears for company.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Butterfly Party</b> (<i>White paper</i>, <i>oil paints, in tubes</i>)</p>

<p>Uncovering the tube, make a dab of paint with it
near middle of a sheet of paper. Immediately beneath
make a <i>long stroke</i> of another color. Now fold over
lengthwise along the middle of the long line of paint.
While folded press and smooth with finger over the
first spot. This when opened will be the head of the
butterfly. Keep paper still folded, however, and press
along the line of paint to make body and then make a
side pressure to make the wings. Open out, and there
is the general suggestion of a beautiful butterfly, which,
held up so that the light shines through, may be really
very pretty. A little experiment will show how improvements
can be made. Any color may be used.
Invite your friends to an evening butterfly party and
give a prize for the best one made; the prize may very
suitably be something in butterfly form; a penwiper,
or lamp-shade, or something similar.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Autograph Picture</b> (<i>Ink</i>, <i>paper</i>, <i>coarse pen</i>)</p>

<p>At the butterfly party, autograph portraits also
may <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
be made. With a coarse pen, filled with ink,
each person writes his own name in turn. Take the
flowing autograph, fold it lengthwise through the middle
and crease, making special pressure at the top and
drawing out slightly at the side. Open up and the
result is a queer portrait of the owner of the autograph
with suggestion of head and arms.</p>

<p>Enclose autograph on two sides by straight lines;
when folded and then opened, the portrait will be
framed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<br />
FESTIVAL OCCASIONS</h2>


<p>Festivals have always held an important place in
the life of home and community. The anniversary of
the day of birth, or of marriage, the day of graduation,
or of coming of age&mdash;what opportunities they
offer for strengthening the ties of kinship, for creating
hallowed associations that may often prove bulwarks
of safety in later days of temptation and sorrow!</p>

<p>Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, are now National
holidays with us, and our celebration of these
beautiful festivals is one more link in the chain which
binds us to all races and creeds; for the return of the sun
at the winter solstice, the renewal of life in the spring,
the ingathering of fruits in the autumn, have appealed
to all peoples as fitting occasions for the expression
of religious joy and for mutual congratulations upon
dangers past and the results of work accomplished.</p>

<p>In the joy of such occasions, we must not let them
degenerate into the mere mercenary exchange of material
gifts.</p>

<p>Christmas is preëminently the children's day,
when we annually remind ourselves of the divinity
inherent in all childhood, and desire to bring joy to
all children and goodwill to all peoples.</p>

<p>Easter means most to the adult who has experienced
sorrow and disappointment and has known
something of the anguish and awe and deepening of
life that comes with the message of Death. The
pleasure of the child in the hare and the Easter egg
must <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
not be allowed altogether to overbalance the
wondrous symbolism of the Easter lily.</p>

<p>The National holidays&mdash;Washington's Birthday,
Memorial Day, Independence Day, etc.&mdash;take us outside
the limits of the home and remind us that, as
we thank the men and women of the past for the
privileges of the present which we owe to their sacrifices
and aspirations, so we should realize our obligations
towards the future.</p>

<p>In celebrating these different festivals, let the
child bear his small part. We give a few ideas of
things which he may do or make. It is these early
impressions which are the lasting ones. The actual
service demanded of the child counts much in the formation
of character, though even more important is
the spirit which radiates at such times from the parents
and friends who celebrate or prepare to celebrate
these recurrent holidays. It is the "spirit which giveth
life," here, as everywhere.</p>

<p>The suggestions will be given in the order in
which the holidays come in the year. Where an article
is described in another part of the book, it will
not be repeated, but the page number will be given for
reference.</p>


<h3>NEW YEAR'S DAY</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Place Cards at Table</b> (<i>White card</i>, <i>pressed four-leaf
clover, or paints</i>)</p>

<p>1. Having found and pressed four-leaved clovers
in the days of summer, paste one lightly to each place
card as symbol of good-luck.</p>

<p>2. Copy a clover-leaf with paints and write on
card some appropriate quotation signifying good-will.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Decorated Note Paper</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
 (<i>Writing paper</i>, <i>leaf</i>, <i>paste
or paints</i>)</p>

<p>Paste a real clover leaf (or paint one) on the
writing paper upon which you may be writing a New
Year's letter to your friend.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Calendar</b> (<i>12 oblong blotters, white or colored</i>, <i>ribbon
to match, 1 inch wide and about &frac34; yards long</i>,
<i>tiny calendar pad</i>, <i>paste</i>)</p>

<p>Take the calendar pad apart and paste the leaf for
each month upon one of the blotters. Then tie the
blotters together with the ribbon. This makes suitable
New Year's gift. (See also <a href="#Page_74">page 74</a>.)</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>New Year's Bells</b> (<i>Red cardboard</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>paste</i>,
<i>ribbon</i>)</p>

<p>Cut out a bell and paste a calendar pad on it.
Or cut 12 small bells and paste one leaf of calendar
pad on each, stringing all together with ribbon.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Good-Luck Pigs</b></p>

<p>With our German population the pig signifies
"good-luck," and at New Year's pigs, big and little,
made of various materials, are quite in order. A favorite
candy, made of sugar and bitter-almond, is
in the shape of a pig, and is used to present to friends
at this holiday time. Many suggestions already given
may be carried out with the pig idea in mind.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Midnight Watching</b></p>

<p>If friends stay up to watch the Old Year out,
any of the above-named articles may be made by the
children for souvenirs. A poem which may suitably
be read at this time is Tennyson's "Ring Out, Wild
Bells;" also, Longfellow's "The Poet's Calendar." A
timely <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
topic for discussion is the never-answered question:
When does the new century begin&mdash;with January
1, 1900, or 1901? Timothy Dwight, President of
Yale College, 1795-1817, wrote some clever verses
apropos of the subject when he helped usher in the
19th Century.</p>


<h3>ST. VALENTINE'S DAY</h3>

<p>Save lace papers from candy and soap boxes and
they will prove useful when St. Valentine's Day comes
in making Valentines. With these papers and scissors,
paste, scrap pictures of flowers, doves, etc., the
children will spend happy hours in making these
dainty souvenirs. We give a few directions for making
some such.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Single Hearts</b> (<i>Red cardboard</i>, <i>lace paper</i>, <i>scrap pictures</i>,
<i>scissors</i>, <i>paste</i>)</p>

<p>Cut a heart out of the cardboard and around the
edge paste a border of lace paper, fulling slightly and
attaching it to the under side of the heart. In the
centre of the upper side of the heart paste a pretty
scrap picture. This makes a simple but effective
Valentine.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Chain of Hearts</b> (<i>Red cardboard</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>scrap pictures</i>,
<i>paste</i>, <i>red ribbon</i>)</p>

<p>Cut several hearts out of the cardboard, and, after
punching holes in the top and bottom of each one,
string them together, pasting a scrap picture on each
one if that added touch is desired.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Double Hearts</b> (<i>Red cardboard</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>paste</i>, <i>strip
of red paper</i>)</p>

<p>Cut two hearts of different sizes. Then take a
narrow <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
strip of red paper measuring &frac14; × 1 inch and
fold it into thirds. While still folded attach one end
of this paper to the <i>centre</i> of the <i>upper side</i> of the
large heart and the other end to the <i>centre</i> of the
<i>lower side</i> of the smaller heart. This unites the two,
one resting on top of the other, the paper acting
as a kind of spring to raise one above the other. Instead
of a small heart a scrap picture may be thus
attached on the larger heart.</p>

<p>In cutting out these hearts it may be necessary
first to cut a pattern out of newspaper, making several
trials before a satisfactory model is secured.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Lacy Valentine</b> (<i>Gold or silver paper</i>, <i>white tissue
paper</i>, <i>scrap pictures</i>, <i>paste</i>)</p>

<p>Cut from a sheet of gold or silver paper a piece
measuring 5 × 7 inches. Fold this once through the
middle so as to make a book of 3&frac12; × 5 inches. Cut a
piece from the tissue paper of 3&frac12; × 5 inches. Fold
this two or three times and cut into it tiny perforations&mdash;oblongs,
diamonds, circles, hearts, etc. Then open
out and observe the lacey effect. Practice this until
something pretty and dainty is secured. Then upon
the centre of the book paste a scrap picture and attach
the tissue paper by its edges to the Valentine
in such a way that the picture shows a little between
the perforations. A narrow strip of stiff paper folded
in three, to give the effect of a spring as described
above, may be used at each corner. Inside of the
booklet paste other pictures as fancy dictates. Also
write therein some appropriate lines.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Spider-Web Design</b> (<i>Gold or silver paper</i>, <i>Bristol
board</i>, <i>scrap picture</i>, <i>paste</i>, <i>scissors</i>)</p>

<p>Cut a circle of gold or silver paper, three or four
inches <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
in diameter. Fold once, making a semi-circle;
fold once more making a quarter-circle. Beginning
at the point of the folded paper, make a tiny cut from
one edge <i>towards</i> the other, but do not cut the point
entirely off. Turn the paper and make a second cut
parallel to the first about &#8539; inch away, the cut being
from the other edge of the paper. Turn again and
make a third cut. Each time the cuts grow in length
owing to the increasing width of the triangle or quarter-circle.
Continue thus until the circumference of
the folded circle is reached. Then open out and you
have a silver spider-web effect. Take a square or
circle somewhat larger than the web, and in its centre
paste a pretty bird, flower, or maiden. Then paste
the web upon this background, putting the paste along
the edges of the web, but leaving the centre free, so
that the child can raise it and peer through the slits
at the picture beneath.</p>

<p>Let city children send to country cousins scrap
pictures, colored papers, etc., and sample Valentines,
so that their friends may have the pleasure of making
and giving.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Valentine Dinner</b></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soup</span>: Put into the clear soup the noodle hearts,
which may be purchased at a grocery store, or have
a vegetable soup, slicing the vegetables and cutting
them into little hearts with a knife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meat</span>: Make chicken or beef croquettes, molding
them like hearts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vegetables</span>: Slice the boiled carrots and potatoes
and cut into heart shapes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bread</span>: Cut into hearts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salad</span>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
 Upon green lettuce leaves place hearts
cut from beets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dessert</span>: Ice cream may be obtained in the
form of a Cupid or something similar, and cake may
be decorated with white icing having pink hearts outlined
upon it. The peppermint candies in the shape
of hearts, which have sentiments printed upon them,
may be passed either at the beginning or the end of
the meal. Cut in half, placing the halves in separate
dishes; then pass one dish to the girls and the other
to the boys, and by matching halves partners may be
found. Let the children, however, remain unconscious
of the distinction of sex as many years as possible.</p>

<p>In making preparations for the dinner let the
children help.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Place Cards for Dinner</b> (<i>Red paper</i>, <i>white cardboard</i>,
<i>scissors</i>, <i>pencil</i>)</p>

<p>Cut a heart from the <i>red</i> paper. From the <i>white</i>,
cut an arrow, drawing it after a pattern found in
some book. Making two slits in the heart, run the
arrow through it. On the reverse side of the heart
write the name of the guest.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Decorations for Valentine Dinner</b> (<i>Red cardboard</i>,
<i>red ribbon</i>)</p>

<p>Cut about two dozen hearts all of same size, or
graduated in size. String these upon the red ribbon
and suspend over the table.</p>


<h3>WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Luncheon Card</b> (<i>1.</i> <i>Picture hatchet</i>, <i>cardboard</i>, <i>scissors</i>,
<i>paints</i>; <i>2.</i> <i>Same</i>&mdash;<i>also white or reddish
brown paper</i>)</p>

<p>1. Find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
 a picture of a hatchet and use it as a
model from which to cut one about two inches long.
Paint this in colors resembling the real hatchet, and
upon the reverse side write the name of the guest.</p>

<p>2. From a piece of white or reddish-brown paper
cut a one-inch square. Paint so as to resemble cherry
wood. Roll so that one edge overlaps the other a
trifle, simulating the trunk of a tree. As they overlap
cut a tiny slit through the two. Cut out a tiny cardboard
hatchet, paint as above, and insert in this slit
so that it holds the two edges together. Before fastening
in this way, an appropriate quotation may be
written inside, and the name of the guest on the outside.
It should stand up if rightly made.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Decorative Cherries</b> (<i>Paraffine</i>, <i>spool of wire, not too
fine</i>, <i>green cloth or paper</i>, <i>carmine oil paint</i>, <i>brush</i>,
<i>paste</i>)</p>

<p>Purchase at the grocer's cakes of paraffine such
as is used for preserving purposes. Heat a cake in a
dish so that it is soft enough to model into balls the
size of a cherry. While still pliable make a slight
depression in its surface. Having previously rolled
the wire in the green tissue paper, and cut into inch
strips for stems, insert this into the cherry at the
depressed part of its surface. Cut out cherry leaves
of paper, or better dark green cloth, place a little paste
on these leaves at the back and arrange a stem on
each one. When the stem of the cherry is firmly fastened
in the fruit, paint the surface with carmine
oil paint. This gives a polished appearance to the
surface like the natural cherry.</p>

<p>The stems of the green leaves may be trimmed
about the stems of the cherries in twos or threes or
more, according to the number of cherries used.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Paper Chains</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
 (<i>Colored paper in sheets or cut into
strips</i>, <i>paste</i>, <i>small brushes or sticks</i>)</p>

<p>The making of paper chains, in contrasting or
uniform colors, is a delightful pastime for children of
all ages. Very little children may easily learn to
make one loop at a time, and, with assistance, are soon
able to fasten several loops together.</p>

<p>Kindergarten Supply Stores furnish strips of
colored paper already cut, and put up in packages.
These strips measure 36 inches in length. It is very
easy, however, to cut strips from large sheets of paper,
and it is an excellent lesson in accurate cutting for
children over ten years of age.</p>

<p>These paper strips may measure one or two inches
in width and the entire length of the sheet. Cut the
long strips into short strips measuring four inches in
length. Holding the four inch strip in the left hand,
put a very little paste on the under surface of one
end of the strip. Overlap the pasted end of the strip
to its unpasted end, and hold firmly until fastened.
You now have one paper loop. Through this loop
is placed another four inch strip&mdash;the paste is added
in the same manner. Now you have two loops. Continue
doing this until you have the chain the required
length. These chains are very effective when used
in decorating.</p>

<p>For Washington's Birthday, red, white and blue
paper would be used for the chains.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Bonbonnieres</b> (<i>White tissue paper</i>, <i>red and blue aniline
dyes</i>)</p>

<p>Very attractive bonbonnieres may be made by
cutting oblong shaped sheets of white tissue paper,
measuring 6 inches in length and 5 inches in width.
Fringe <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the shorter edges of the paper, making fringe
1 inch deep.</p>

<p>Dissolve any good red and blue dyes in boiling
water, and place in separate dishes. Dip one fringed
end of tissue paper into the red dye for one second,
and dip the other fringed end into the blue dye.
Shake these ends gently in order to let the water
drip from them. When they are dry, place a large
sized candy in the centre of the paper, and gathering
up the fringed ends, twist them close to the candy,
thus forming a feathery effect in two colors. These
are very pretty when arranged on the table either in
quantity or singly.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Tents</b> (<i>White shelf paper</i>, <i>paste</i>, <i>match stick</i>, <i>red,
white and blue paper</i>)</p>

<p>Groups of white tents, made of white shelf paper,
capped at the top with tiny American flags, may be
placed at short distances from the centre piece of a
luncheon or supper table with good effect.</p>

<p>The large sheets of shelf paper may be bought
at any grocer's. Cut them into four-inch squares.
Place the paper before you on a flat surface, an edge
nearest you. Fold the front edge to the back edge of
square; crease the paper at the fold, open the paper and
fold the right edge to left edge of square; crease the
fold again. Open the paper and turn the square so that
a corner points towards you. Fold this front corner
to the back corner, so that the two points exactly
meet.</p>

<p>Crease on the fold, open the paper, and fold the
left corner to the right corner of the square. Crease
on the fold. Open the paper; before you you have
a square of paper, with eight folds across its surface,
a fold running front edge to back edge, from right
edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
 to left edge, from right corner to left corner,
from left corner to right corner. Turn the square
of paper over so that all the folds on the surface of
the paper are on the upper side of the square. Place
the square with a corner toward you.</p>

<p>You will now see eight folds running from the
four edges and four corners to the centre of the
square. Crease with thumb and forefinger of right hand
the fold running from lower right edge to centre of
square. Place this right hand fold of square forward
so that it lies along the fold which extends from the
corner directly in front of you to the centre of the
square. Follow the same directions in folding the
crease that runs from the lower left edge to centre of
square. These two folds touch now on the fold that
runs from front corner to centre of square. You
will see a small triangle extending below the two folds
which thus meet in front of you. Fold this small
triangle back toward the centre, and underneath the
two folds that meet in front of you. One half of your
tent is folded. The same directions must be followed
in folding the other side of the square.</p>

<p>The two small triangles must be carefully folded
so that the tent will stand evenly when finished. You
will see when the front and back part of the tent is
finished that you have the right and left corners to
dispose of. Fold these corners underneath the tent,
so that when it is placed in an upright position it will
stand firmly. To make the tent stand well, crease the
edges that run from the four corners to top of tent,
thus making an exact pyramid. The use of a little
paste in securing the folds is of great assistance.</p>

<p>To represent the tent pole, a wooden match,
gilded, may be used. To this attach a tiny American
flag made of pliable red, white and blue paper.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Paper Lanterns</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
 (<i>Scissors</i>, <i>red, white and blue paper</i>,
<i>liquid gold paint</i>, <i>box of small candles</i>, <i>circular
box covers</i>, <i>baby ribbon&mdash;red, white and blue</i>)</p>

<p>Lanterns made of red, white and blue paper,
each of one color only, ornamented with gold paint
and tied with the red, white and blue baby ribbon,
are extremely pretty for supper decorations. When
suspended from the chandelier above the centre of a
supper table, a lighted candle in each little lantern,
the effect is charming.</p>

<p>In view of entertainments where decorations are
called for, it would be well to lay aside all small circular
box covers that find their way into the household.
The small box covers that measure 2&frac12; inches
in diameter may be taken as a standard size. These
box covers form the bottom of the lanterns.</p>

<p>Cut from the colored paper an oblong piece measuring
8 inches in length and 5 inches in width. Lay
the oblong piece of paper before you with its long
edges running right and left. Draw a pencil line the
length of the paper &frac34; of an inch from the upper edge;
&frac34; of an inch from its lower edge draw another line
which will be parallel to the first.</p>

<p>From the upper pencil line to the lower pencil
line draw 15 lines &frac12; inch apart. These upright lines
will form 14 narrow oblongs. Use very sharp pointed
scissors, and cut away each alternate oblong. Paste
the two short edges of the oblong paper together,
one end overlapping the other. The body of the lantern
is now finished.</p>

<p>Let a little wax drip from a candle on the inside
of the circular box cover at its centre. When a
little bed of soft wax is formed, place an unlighted
candle on it in an upright position. Place a thick
coating of Spaulding's glue on the inner surface of
circular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
 rim of the box cover, and carefully fit the
body of the lantern into it.</p>

<p>When the paper lantern is securely fastened, gild
heavily the outside rim of the box cover and the upper
and lower circular bands which form top and bottom
borders of the lanterns. In the top circular band
punch four holes equal distances apart, through which
the ribbons are run.</p>


<h3>ST. PATRICK'S DAY&mdash;MARCH 17TH</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Place Cards</b> (<i>White cards</i>, <i>water-color or oil paints</i>,
<i>brush</i>)</p>

<p>Paint a picture of shamrock upon the card. It
may be copied from some picture, if not from the
real plant. If not possible to find a picture, our wild-wood-sorrel
(<i>Oxalis acetosella</i>) is supposed to be
the same as the shamrock and may be used for model.
Some authorities believe the white clover to be the
original shamrock.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Flags</b> (<i>Irish flag</i>, <i>green paint</i>, <i>gold paint</i>, <i>brush</i>, <i>scissors</i>,
<i>slender sticks</i>)</p>

<p>If one Irish flag is bought the children may copy
it, painting a number, one for each guest, or for
decorating table. Glue flags to sticks.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Ribbon Flags</b> (<i>Green satin ribbon, one inch wide</i>,
<i>wooden toothpick</i>)</p>

<p>Cut the ribbon into oblongs to make wee flags.
Glue to tiny flagsticks and put at places at dinner
table.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Shamrock Plants</b></p>

<p>The real shamrock is now brought over and may
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
 purchased in March. A little plant makes an appropriate
souvenir. Or several weeks before the day,
children may plant shamrock seed in tiny pots for
use on the 17th.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Potato Race</b></p>

<p>A potato race is an appropriate game for St. Patrick's
Day. (See <a href="#Page_94">page 94</a>.) Give cork doll for prize
to winner of race (<a href="#Page_81">page 81</a>), as souvenir from Cork.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>St. Patrick's Dinner</b></p>

<p>Have as many green vegetables and side dishes
as possible. Spinach will color the soup. Green vegetables
and salads are easy to obtain and ice cream
may be colored with pistache. Irish flags may be suspended
over the table.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Dinner Souvenir</b> (<i>Blotting paper</i>, <i>souvenir postcards</i>,
<i>green ribbon &frac12; inch wide</i>)</p>

<p>Give each guest a blotter made thus: Buy souvenir
postcards with pictures of Killarney and other
Irish views. Cut the blotting paper into sheets of
same size as cards. Place together. Punch hole at
one end and tie together with ribbon.</p>


<h3>EASTER</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Egg Shell Garden</b> (See <a href="#Page_25">page 25</a>)</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Sponge Garden</b> (<i>Small, clean sponge</i>, <i>birdseed</i>)</p>

<p>A few days before Easter, sprinkle the sponge
with birdseed. Keep damp and the seeds will sprout
and cover the sponge with growing blades of green.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Easter Eggs</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
 (<i>1.</i> <i>Diamond dyes</i>, <i>a dozen eggs</i>. <i>2.</i>
<i>Small figured calico</i>, <i>lye</i>, <i>boiling water</i>)</p>

<p>1. Boil the eggs hard and dye with the colors
according to directions on package, which may be
had at drugstore, price five cents.</p>

<p>2. Wind strips of the bright calico around the
eggs and boil in water strongly saturated with lye.
The lye extracts the color, which will be found printed
upon the eggs.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Place Cards for Easter Breakfast</b> (<i>1.</i> <i>White paper</i>,
<i>scissors</i>, <i>paints</i>. <i>2.</i> <i>Plain white cards</i>, <i>paints</i>)</p>

<p>1. If possible secure a real Easter lily for a model.
If this cannot be obtained, a picture of one will answer.
From the paper cut, freehand, if possible, the
shape of the lily and paint it lightly; just a little shading
and the golden center. Place the guest's name
upon the reverse side. It may be necessary to draw
the lily first before cutting, but the freehand cutting
is a good exercise.</p>

<p>2. Decorate a white card with the picture of a
lily, or a tulip, using water-color paints. Below the
flower write an appropriate flower motto.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Celluloid Place Cards</b> (<i>White celluloid</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>pencil</i>)</p>

<p>Get from a dictionary or natural history a good
picture of a butterfly with open wings. Draw a pattern
from this and then outline a number of these on
the celluloid and cut out. These dainty, spirit-like butterflies
will make suitable place-cards, having the name
of guest on the reverse side.</p>

<p>Cut Easter lily of celluloid in same way.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Easter Chicken</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
 (<i>Yellow worsted</i>, <i>black beads</i>, <i>quill
toothpick</i>, <i>cardboard</i>, <i>wooden toothpicks</i>, <i>or picture-wire</i>.)</p>

<p>Make a yellow ball as described on pages 96-7 for
the body of the chicken. A smaller ball makes the
head. Sew on the beads for the bright black eyes;
cut the quill into shape of a bill and sew into place.
Let wooden toothpicks form the legs; or, better still,
take picture-wire made of several strands. Wind some
of this around the body, letting the ends of the wire
extend about 1&frac12; inches below the body; sew to the
body to keep in place. Then pick out the ends of
the wire a little to suggest toes and wind the legs
with worsted. Sew chicken to a card.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Easter Card</b> (<i>Parquetry circles used in kindergarten</i>,
<i>paste</i>, <i>gray card</i>, <i>scissors</i>)</p>

<p>The little child may make an Easter card by
pasting upon a neutral-tinted card pictures of tulips
made of the kindergarten parquetry papers. Cut in
half either red or yellow circles. Place so that the
lower ends touch and the upper ones are a little
apart, suggesting a tulip. A strip of green paper will
represent the stem and an older child can cut leaves
of the green paper and paste on. Have a real tulip
from which to copy. Child may give this to Father
on Easter morning.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy Screen</b> (See <a href="#Page_63">page 63</a>)</p>

<p>Make dainty screen as described, and paste on
each panel a tiny <i>Easter</i> picture (Perry pictures may
be had by addressing firm in N. Y. City). Give to
Mother on Easter morning.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Church Window Transparency</b> (See <a href="#Page_77">page 77</a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<h3>MEMORIAL DAY</h3>

<p>We give no special suggestions for the celebration
of Memorial or Decoration Day. The ideas given
under the headings of the other patriotic holidays, as
Washington's Birthday and Fourth of July, may be
used also for this holiday, but it is not a day for mere
play.</p>

<p>If the parents plan to go to the cemetery let the
child accompany them and carry flowers, preferably
those of his own raising or plucking.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>It would be well also on this day to read some
great piece of patriotic literature, either prose or
poetry, which will help the older children to realize
the great debt which we owe to the preservers of our
country, to whom we dedicate this day. Lincoln's
Gettysburg address should be read. Also Lowell's
"The Present Crisis." "Bugle Echoes," compiled by
Francis F. Browne, contains 150 poems of the Civil
War, both Northern and Southern.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Badge</b> (<i>Sheets of red, white, and blue paper</i>, <i>scissors</i>,
<i>paste</i>)</p>

<p>A simple badge may be made for the children to
wear in this fashion:</p>

<p>1. Cut a circle &frac34; inches in diameter out of the
red paper. Cut also from the red, white and blue
sheets strips of 2 × 5 inches. Paste the three strips
together at the upper end like ribbons, letting them
spread a little apart at the lower end. Paste the circle
at the upper end to finish off.</p>

<p>2. Another style may be made by placing the
three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
 colors so that one lies directly above the other.
In this case the blue is 5 inches long, the white four
inches, and the red three inches. Fasten to dress or
coat with a safety pin.</p>


<h3>INDEPENDENCE DAY</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Firecrackers</b> (<i>Red paper</i>, <i>hemp</i> <i>string</i>, <i>paste</i>)</p>

<p>Get large sheets of red paper to be found at
department stores or wholesale paper houses, measuring
about 35 inches in length and 26 inches in width.
From each one cut thirteen 2-inch strips, cutting the
length of the sheet. Fold each strip once across the
width of the strip, and cut through the center at the
fold. This gives twenty-six 2-inch strips of paper,
the width of the small sized firecrackers.</p>

<p>Hold a strip of paper between the thumb and
forefinger of the left hand. Moisten the thumb of
the right hand a very little, and roll the end of the
strip towards the left, as one does in rolling a paper
taper. Keep the strip rolled tightly until the other
end of the strip is reached. If the cracker seems too
loosely rolled unroll it a short distance, and gently
pull the strip into form again.</p>

<p>Place a little paste on the under side of the loose
end of the strip, and press the pasted end firmly on
the rolled surface of the cracker. Hold this until it
adheres to the surface of the cracker. Cut the hemp
string into three-inch pieces. Dip one end of the
string into the paste, then insert this pasted end into
one end of the cracker at the little opening which is

<p class="hang2"><b>Drums</b> (<i>Small wooden boxes</i>, <i>liquid gold paint</i>,
<i>Spaulding's glue</i>, <i>red, white and blue baby ribbon</i>,
<i>small sticks for drum sticks</i>)</p>

<p>The market basket will, from time to time, furnish
the housekeeper with small circular boxes labeled:
Electro-Silicon Silver Polish. These wooden boxes,
measuring 8 inches in circumference and 12 inches
in height, make, when prettily ornamented, very attractive
drums.</p>

<p>Remove the cover of box, and place on its inner
rim a coating of Spaulding's glue. Place the cover
on the box again, and put aside until it is fastened.
Place the box on a sheet of stiff white paper, and
holding it firmly, draw a pencil line around its edge.
Now remove the box, and you will see that you have
outlined a circle. Using this circle as a model, draw
a second circle. Cut out these circles, following the
pencil very accurately. These two circles form the
two heads of the drum, and are to be pasted on the
top and the bottom of the box. Gild the circular surface
of the box. Cut strips of red or blue paper,
measuring 8&frac12; inches in length and 1&frac12; inches in
width. Brush the under surface of these strips with
paste, and place one strip at the top and one at the
bottom of the drum, &frac34; of an inch above the rim of
the drum. These strips answer to the wooden bands
which hold the drum heads in place. Red, white and
blue baby ribbon may be carried from the upper to the
lower edges of the drum if desired to represent the
cords which hold the drum securely.</p>

<p>Little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
 wooden sticks, gilded and tied at the side
of the drum form the drumsticks.</p>

<p>The smaller Electro-Silicon boxes, measuring 2&frac34;
inches in circumference and 1 &#8531; inches in height, may
be used in the same way.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Rosettes</b> (<i>Red, white and blue tissue paper</i>, <i>a strong
needle</i>, <i>white sewing silk</i>, <i>white library paste or
well-made flour paste</i>)</p>

<p>Lay nine sheets of tissue paper one upon another,
alternating the colors, red, white and blue. Fold
these sheets together very smoothly once, thus making
18 smaller sheets if they were cut apart, but do
not cut. Lay a silver dollar or fifty-cent piece (depending
upon the size required) at the upper left-hand
corner of paper. Draw a pencil line around the
rim of the silver piece. Move the piece of money to
the right and draw another circle. Continue this
drawing circles until you have covered the surface of
the paper.</p>

<p>Thread a needle with the sewing silk, knot the
end of the thread and take several firm stitches
through the center of each circle in order to hold the
sheets of paper together. With sharp scissors cut
out each paper circle, and fringe by cutting, but not
too finely, from the edge to within &#8539; of an inch of
the center of the circle. Hold the knot on the under
side of the circle between the thumb and forefinger
of the left hand. Slightly moisten the forefinger of
the right hand and brush gently over the fringed
surface toward the center of the rosette. At the back
of each rosette put a bit of paste, then lay rosettes
on strips of paper one inch in width. Do not overlap
the rosettes, but arrange to allow the edges to touch.</p>

<p>These strips of rosettes may be used as festoons.

<p class="hang2"><b>Shields for Luncheon Cards</b> (<i>Cardboard</i>, <i>red and
blue paper</i>, <i>baby ribbon&mdash;red, white and blue</i>,
<i>gold paint</i>, <i>water-color paints&mdash;red and blue</i>)</p>

<p>Attractive luncheon or supper cards, suitable for
patriotic occasions, may be made in the form of
shields. Turn to the fourth page of Webster's Unabridged
Dictionary, and find the shield used as the
American Coat-of-Arms. This shield, enlarged to a
size measuring 2&frac12; inches in length and 2&frac12; inches
in width across the upper part, forms an excellent
model. If one does not draw habitually, use tracing
paper when tracing the pattern. If one uses watercolor
paints successfully, paint the deep blue band
across the upper part of the shield, and the twelve
red stripes running from the band to the lower edge
of the shield. For those who do not paint, dark red
and blue paper may be substituted very successfully.
A touch of gold paint on the edge of the shield adds
greatly to the effect.</p>

<p>Write each guest's name on a card measuring 2&frac12;
inches in length and 1&frac12; inches in width. Attach a
card by means of red, white and blue ribbon to upper
corner of each shield.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Rockets</b> (<i>Red, white and blue paper</i>, <i>paste</i>, <i>gold paint</i>,
<i>slender wooden sticks</i>)</p>

<p>Rockets are made in the same manner as firecrackers,
excepting that the paper strips are cut wider,
viz.: 3 or 4 inches in width, and more strips are required
to give the proper size. This may be left to
the maker's discretion.</p>

<p>When the rockets are rolled and pasted after the
manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
 of the firecrackers, insert the sharp point of
a pencil into the center of one end of each roll, and
gently push out this center to the distance of two
inches. This will give the pointed end of the rocket.
These pointed ends may be gilded, as well as the slender
sticks which are inserted at the other ends.</p>


<h3>LABOR DAY</h3>

<p>The words "parade" and "procession" are associated
in the minds of most American children with
long lines of soldiers, and the small boy will play for
hours putting his tin soldiers in rank and file, or
marching with his comrades, with pans for drums.</p>

<p>In these later days, when the spirit of the Peace
Congress is in the air, it is well that the children
should become interested in struggles and battles of
a different and higher order and in the parades in
which long lines of honorable workers take part.</p>

<p>In this country all self-respecting people are
workers in one way or another, and though in the
course of progress of coöperative movements and combinations,
among many kinds of workers, there may
have been much of injustice, such movements have
also been accompanied by self-sacrifice, courage and
generosity of a high order. In time the good will
far out-weigh the evil. As Labor Day approaches, the
children, especially if the father expects to take part,
will be readily interested in the day and what it
should mean&mdash;the solving of the great problem of
the twentieth century. Meanwhile let the children
feel the beauty of Walt Whitman's lines:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2q">"Ah little recks the laborer<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How near his work is holding him to God,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The loving Laborer through space and time."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Labor Day parade is a revival, or survival
in modern guise, of the mediæval processions of the
Guilds. Such a procession is charmingly represented
in Wagner's delightful opera, "Die Meistersinger,"
wherein, on a festival day, we see the bakers enter,
bearing the insignia of their trade, enormous pretzels
and other cakes. The cobblers march in with gigantic
boots and slippers suspended from tall poles; the
butchers carry hams and festoons of sausages, etc.
The child may imitate such a parade in his play.</p>

<p>In talking with the child, emphasize the obligation
to do good, true work and to take pride in such.
Let fidelity and trustworthiness be his watchwords.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Parade</b> (<i>Poles or broom handles</i>, <i>wrapping paper or
newspaper</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>tacks</i>, <i>rakes</i>, <i>spades</i>, <i>etc.</i>,
<i>flags and banners</i>)</p>

<p>Let the children cut from the paper large outlines
of shoes, boots, hams, saws, try-squares, clocks,
watches, enormous pens, knives, forks, etc., and fasten
with pins or tacks to the poles. Then march to the
tune of some stirring air.</p>

<p>Some may be able to secure small garden rakes,
spades and toy brooms to carry. The American flag
and banners should also be carried.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Toy-Processions</b> (<i>Trade catalogues</i>, <i>toothpicks</i>, <i>paper
dolls</i>, <i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p>Cut out paper dolls and let each one carry a tiny
toothpick upon which has been pasted a picture cut
from some catalogue. These catalogues will furnish
pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
 of shoes, carriages, saws, hammers, watches,
furniture, etc. Be sure that little American flags are
also carried. Dolls may be glued to spools for standards.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Place Cards for Dinner</b></p>

<p>1. (<i>Bristol board</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>paints</i>, <i>brush</i>)</p>

<p>Make place cards of Bristol board, which may
be cut into shape of shoes, watches, etc., and painted
accordingly. The name of guest may be placed on
reverse side. Or, on plain white card, paint a picture
emblematic of a trade and write upon it also some
quotation from a writer of democratic spirit.</p>

<p>2. (<i>Tiny cast-iron rakes, spades and hatchets&mdash;1
cent each.</i>)</p>

<p>As a souvenir, give each guest a tiny cast-iron
spade, rake and hatchet tied together with cord. Or,
for a joke, these may be placed by each plate instead of
knife, fork and spoon.</p>

<p>3. (<i>Pen and ink or pencil</i>, <i>white card</i>.)</p>

<p>Draw on a plain, white card a picture of an ant,
bee or beaver as emblematic of labor. Use for place
cards.</p>

<p>4. (<i>Frances S. Osgood's poem, "Labor,"</i> <i>white
cards</i>, <i>pen and ink</i>.)</p>

<p>On each card write one stanza of this beautiful
poem, and after the close of the meal let each guest
in turn read the lines on his card. It would be well
for every child to commit this poem to memory. It
is long, but sings itself easily into the mind. The
word-pictures it calls up are exquisite and the learning
of it, little by little, would not be an unhappy task.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<h3>HALLOWE'EN</h3>

<p>This is the festival which is given over to all
kinds of merry pranks and is dearly loved by the children.
It is an opportunity to teach them to discriminate
between the fun which is kindly and that which
is malicious and productive of needless pain.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Ducking for Apples and Nuts</b> (<i>Large pans or tubs</i>,
<i>apples</i>, <i>nuts</i>, <i>pennies</i>)</p>

<p>Let the children, young and old, for once get
themselves wet, if necessary, in ducking for the nuts
and apples floating in the water. With a little suction
some of the children will be able to get pennies
from the bottom of the tub.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Fortune-Telling</b></p>

<p>1. With Needles. (<i>Needles</i>, <i>pan of water</i>)</p>

<p>Name a needle for yourself and one for a friend,
and put in the water, but not together. If they move
safely across, it betokens good luck. Two needles
meeting indicate life partnership.</p>

<p>2. With Toy Ships. (<i>Pan of water</i>, <i>nut ships as
described on <a href="#Page_22">page 22</a></i> )</p>

<p>Name one little vessel for yourself and one for a
friend and set them afloat. If they come to port on
the other side all is well.</p>

<p>3. With Apple Rinds. (<i>Apple</i>, <i>knife</i>)</p>

<p>Pare an apple so that the skin comes off in one
long piece. Toss over the head upon the floor, and
the form it takes will give the initial letters of the name
of one's future mate.</p>

<p>4. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
 Cake. (<i>Cake</i>, <i>thimble</i>, <i>ring</i>, <i>penny</i>, <i>etc.</i>)</p>

<p>Bake a cake, hiding in the dough a thimble, a
ring and a penny. When cut, the recipient of the ring
is fore-doomed to marriage; the one getting the thimble
will be a spinster; the one receiving the penny will
have the pleasures and responsibilities of wealth.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Apple-Biting Contest</b> (<i>Apple suspended from a
string</i>)</p>

<p>1. The apple is set swinging and two people,
standing opposite each other, try as it passes to seize
and hold it in the mouth. They must not touch it with
the hands.</p>

<p>2. Tie an apple by its stem to the middle of a
string about a yard long. Then two people, each taking
one end of the string in the mouth, begin, at a
signal, to gather it as fast as possible into the mouth,
and so to reach the apple. This belongs to the one
reaching it first.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Refreshments</b></p>

<p>Apples, nuts, popcorn, cider, gingerbread and
doughnuts are suitable for lighter refreshments.
Baked beans and plain ice-cold rice pudding were
once eaten with decided relish at a New York City
Hallowe'en party, the city people evidently enjoying
the contrast between this feast and the usual caterer's
service. Serve fruit from a kettle suspended from
three cross-sticks, <i>a la</i> witch.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Decorations</b></p>

<p>Jack-o'-lanterns of pumpkins; strings of apples,
popcorn and cranberries, and toy brooms hung here
and there, as reminders of the witches who are said
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
 be abroad, will add to the occasion. The pumpkins
should be cut to resemble skulls.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>Have some one read "Tam O'Shanter's Mare"
(Burns); also some good ghost story. Thomas Kendrick
Bangs' "Ghosts Which I Have Met" contains
some good stories, all absurd. Choose a good reader
for this.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Place Cards</b></p>

<p>1. (<i>White or tinted cards</i>, <i>Palmer Cox Brownies</i>,
<i>ink</i>, <i>pen</i>)</p>

<p>The Brownies are delightfully funny little people
without a suggestion of anything coarse or evil. The
children love them. Let the older ones copy and cut
them out to use as invitation cards for the Hallowe'en
party or for place cards.</p>

<p>2. (See "Pricking," <a href="#Page_165">page 165</a>.)</p>

<p>Since witches are always associated with the
pricking of pins, this is an appropriate occasion for
using the kindergarten pricking. Outline some of the
Brownies on tinted cards and prick as directed on
<a href="#Page_165">page 165</a>.</p>

<h3>THANKSGIVING</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Place Cards</b> (<i>White paper or cardboard</i>, <i>brush and
paints or pen and ink</i>)</p>

<p>1. Cut out a turkey, copying from some picture
if necessary. (Picture may be found in dictionary.)
If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
 skilful with brush or pen, indicate the feathers,
eye, etc.</p>

<p>2. Draw picture of a pumpkin. Cut it out. Paint
in deep orange tones with shadings of brown. Cut into
it eyes, nose and mouth, suggesting Jack-o'-lantern.</p>

<p>3. On white cards write stanzas from Whittier's
poem, "The Pumpkin Pie," and let each guest read
his stanza in turn.</p>

<p>4. Cut as many triangles as there are guests and
paint each to resemble a slice of pie. One side of
triangle should be curved.</p>

<p>5. Find a simple figure of a Puritan maiden and
draw in outline; then cut out and paint or draw in
black ink the important lines. Use as place card.</p>

<p>6. Make little walnut boats (see <a href="#Page_22">page 22</a>), and
on each sail write name of guest.</p>

<p>7. Find picture of Mayflower and copy on white
card. On reverse side write a stanza of "The Breaking
Waves Dashed High." Let each guest read his
lines. (Or parts of "Hiawatha" about Mondamin
may be used.)</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Table Souvenirs</b> (<i>Tiny cast-iron gardening tools, 1
cent each</i>)</p>

<p>As described under Labor Day, these tiny penny
tools may be put at each place, the hatchet representing
the knife, the rake the fork, and the spade the
spoon. Attach name of guest to set.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Butter Modeling</b> (<i>Clay modeling tools</i>, <i>firm butter</i>)</p>

<p>If any child has acquired a little skill in clay
modeling, let him try his hand at modeling out of
firm butter some form expressing a Thanksgiving
thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
 It may be a piece of fruit, or some animal.
Get clay modeling tools at art store.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Center Piece</b> (<i>Pumpkin</i>, <i>knife</i>, <i>fruits and vegetables</i>)</p>

<p>Hollow out a pumpkin in such a way that a part
of the rind is left as a handle to the remaining part,
which serves as a basket. Into this basket put a
variety of fruits and vegetables, emblematic of the
bounties for which we are grateful.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Jack-o'-lantern</b> (<i>Pumpkin</i>, <i>knife</i>, <i>candle</i>)</p>

<p>We doubt if any boy needs to be told how to cut
a face in a pumpkin. A sharp knife will soon make
the cuts for eyes, nose and mouth in the rind, the
seedy contents having been previously removed. A
hollow may be cut in the bottom of the interior to hold
the candle, which can be made still steadier by melting
a little from the bottom and letting it drip into this
hollow, forming a waxy bed into which the candle
may be inserted.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Candlesticks</b></p>

<p>See <a href="#Page_24">pages 24</a> and <a href="#Page_64">64</a> for those made of apples
and of cardboard and colored papers.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Room Decorations</b></p>

<p>1. Corn Stalks. (<i>Strong cord and needle</i>, <i>hammer
and tacks</i>.)</p>

<p>Stack cornstalks in the corners of the rooms in
effective positions, two or three to a corner. Those
living in cities may find it well to secure these from
farmer friends some time before the holiday.</p>

<p>2. Unhusked Ears of Field Corn. (<i>Strong cord.</i>)</p>

<p>The corn husks must be turned back from the
ears and cut off from them without loosening the separate
leaves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
 Then a number of these husks may be
strung upon a strong thread or string alternating
with the ears of corn. Hang along the upper part of
the wall as a frieze. The rich, warm tones of the
brown and yellow are very effective.</p>

<p>3.  Cranberries and Brussels Sprouts. (<i>String</i>,
<i>needle</i>.)</p>

<p>Run upon a string half a dozen cranberries, then
a Brussels sprout; then more cranberries, etc., and
suspend this as a festoon along mantelshelf, in chandelier,
or over window.</p>

<p>4. Autumn Leaves. (See <a href="#Page_47">page 47</a>.)</p>

<p>5. Autumn Boughs. (<i>Oak boughs.</i>)</p>

<p>Oak boughs, with the rich red and russet leaves
still upon them, are very handsome in the autumn.
The beautiful branches may be gathered by the young
people and hung in parts of the room where most
effective.</p>


<h3>CHRISTMAS</h3>


<p class="hang2"><b>Place Cards</b></p>

<p>1. (<i>Sheet black paper</i>, <i>Chinese white water-color

(obtainable at kindergarten supply store). With
the paint, paint in white toes and heels. On the reverse
side write some appropriate quotation and name
of guest. Stockings may be about four inches long.</p>

<p>2. (<i>White paper</i>, <i>black ink or crayon</i>.) Cut a
rough figure of a snowman out of white paper, put in
features with black ink or crayon, and write name on

<i>mucilage</i>)</p>

<p>Cut two circles of cotton cloth, stuff with the batting,
after sewing into shape of ball. Cover lightly

<p class="hang2"><b>Candles</b> (<i>Paraffine or old candles</i>, <i>kettle</i>, <i>soft cotton
string</i>, <i>small box of sand</i>, <i>pencil</i>)</p>

<p>Candles have sometimes been made in the kindergarten
in either of the following ways:</p>

<p>1. Heat a pound of paraffine (bought at grocer's),
or melt up some old candle ends in a kettle. Place in
front of the child a cigar box containing about a
quart of moist sand, smoothed level. Then with his
pencil let him press into the sand, making a deep, hollow
mold just the width of the pencil. Now let him
hold a short piece of string so that it hangs down into
this mold. An older person will then pour some of
the melted wax into the mold. It will cling to the
string, and in a moment or two will cool enough to be
drawn out, making a little candle that can be used for
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
 Christmas tree, or put into a clay candlestick, also
made by the child. (<a href="#Candlesticks">See below.</a>)</p>

<p>2. Put the kettle containing the melted wax before
the child and let him dip into it a piece of string about
four inches long. Then let him take it out in a moment
and lay it aside to cool. A very little wax will
cling to it. Meanwhile he dips in another string and
puts aside to cool. When cool he takes up the first
one and dips it in a second time, and a new coat of
wax adheres. He proceeds thus until the candles are
as large in diameter as desired (about &frac12; inch at base).
The candles may be put into clay candlesticks, also
made by the child.</p>


<p class="hang2"><a name="Candlesticks" id="Candlesticks"></a><b>Candlesticks</b> (<i>Clay</i>, <i>a tin or china candlestick to use
as model</i>)</p>

<p>Let the child take a candlestick and copy in clay;
it should be of simple form, a mere cylinder, with
just enough of a base to make a firm standard.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Candlesticks</b> (<i>Cardboard</i>, <i>scissors</i>)</p>

<p>Cut small squares of cardboard. The candles may
be made to stand temporarily upon these by melting
the lower ends of the candles and letting some of the
wax drip upon center of the cards, and then pressing
the candle down upon the melted wax. These may
be placed upon the table on Christmas morning.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Christmas Carols</b></p>

<p>Let the children learn some simple old carol, as
a secret, and Christmas morning have them sing it
softly and sweetly to awaken father. A full program
of songs suitable for this most beautiful of days
will be found in the little book, "The Children's Messiah,"
compiled by Mari Ruef Hofer, price 20 cents.

Fold once into an oblong. Now cut a series of parallel
lines from the fold toward the edge, stopping each
about &frac12; inch from edge. Open and paste one end so
that it overlaps the other, the cuts running vertically.
This makes the lantern bulge out a little at the fold,
giving a Japanese lantern effect. Suspend by a thread
tied to the upper edge or paste a narrow strip of paper
on for a handle. Use as decoration for Christmas tree.</p>

THE KEY BASKET</h2>

<p class="center">or</p>

<p class="center pb"><span class="smcap">Household Duties and Responsibilities</span></p>


<p>Train the children little by little to bear certain
light responsibilities in the home. Even in a home
in which all the household tasks are done by trained
servants let the girl and boy have some small duty
to perform, if it be nothing more than to keep the
match-safes filled. They will thus acquire an interest
in the home which can be aroused in no other way.</p>

<p>Indeed, every child, boy and girl, should be trained
to do easily and well the common household tasks
upon which depend so much of the happiness and well-being
of the home. Such knowledge and skill often
prove of use in unexpected emergencies and make for
general efficiency. The ancient symbol of the housewife's
office is her bunch of keys, hung at her waist
or placed in the key-basket, so we have used this latter
phrase as our chapter heading.</p>


<h3>HOME TASKS</h3>

<p>Here are a few brief directions for the usual
home tasks in which both boys and girls may to some
extent be trained.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Table Setting</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
 (<i>Usual dishes and cutlery</i>)</p>

<p>Different homes vary in unimportant particulars
in the placing of the dishes. The following is a common
arrangement for the dinner table:</p>

<p>At each place lay the fork vertically at the left-hand
side, the knife vertically at the right, and the
soup-spoon to the right of the knife. This places each
utensil so that it is ready for the hand which uses it
most. Put the teaspoons to the right of the soup-spoon,
and the napkin to the left of the fork. Place
the glass just above the knife, the butterdish above the
fork, and the individual salt-cellar, if used, between
the two.</p>

<p>Father and mother sit at the ends of the table.
Put carving-knife and fork at father's place; also the
soup ladle, as father serves the soup and carves.
Mother pours the coffee and tea and serves the vegetables.
Therefore the soup and dinner dishes must
be placed before the carver, and the needed vegetable
dishes and cups and saucers at the mother's place.
Here, too, must be placed the sugar bowl and cream
pitcher.</p>

<p>In the United States it is customary to serve
most vegetables upon individual saucers. In England
they are usually served upon the plate.</p>

<p>If salad is to be served, oil and vinegar cruets
may be put on.</p>

<p>The dessert is usually served by the mother, and
the necessary dishes must, therefore, be placed at her
end of the table.</p>

<p>If possible, always have flowers or a growing
plant in the center of the table, but do not have it so
high that it obscures the view of those persons sitting
on opposite sides of the table.</p>

<p>Upon special occasions, particularly if the guests
are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
 many, it is convenient to indicate the place of
each person by a "place card" bearing his name and
decorated in some appropriate fashion. Suggestions
for such place cards will be found on other pages of
this volume.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Table-Serving</b> (<i>Tray</i>)</p>

<p>Train both boys and girls to wait on the table
<i>quietly</i> and <i>quickly</i>. Then they can save mother many
weary steps. Remove soup-tureen first; then the individual
dishes. After the meat-course, remove first
the platter and vegetable dishes; then the plates, saucers,
etc., from each individual place; then, if there
is no salad course, the bread and butter dishes, cruets,
etc., from center of table. Next the table must be
crumbed. Do this by quietly removing crumbs from
each place with crumb-knife and tray or by brushing
with folded napkin. If salad is served, crumbing
takes place after that course.</p>

<p>Hold all dishes to left of guest, so that he may
easily help himself with his right hand.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Dish-Washing</b> (<i>Hot water in quantity</i>, <i>dish pan</i>, <i>wire
tray</i>, <i>drainer</i>, <i>washing-soda</i>, <i>soap</i>, <i>dish-mop</i>, <i>washcloth</i>,
<i>towels in plenty, both coarse and fine</i>)</p>

<p>If two people are to work together, let one collect
the dishes and dispose of the left-over food, while
the other washes the kettles and saucepans. Get these
heavy cooking utensils out of the way the first thing;
then the drudgery part is over before the workers are
tired out.</p>

<p>Dishes in which potatoes, cereals, or eggs have
been cooked should be put to soak, not in hot, but in
cold or tepid water; they are then readily cleaned.
Fill with water as soon as emptied.</p>

<p>Keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
 a little washing-soda on hand, dissolved
in water in a canning-jar, for cleansing greasy dishes.
Have hot water in abundance, and, putting a little
soda in with it, scrub the kettles briskly with the wire-brush
that comes for the purpose, or with mop, dish-cloth
or chain dish-cloth. Wipe dry with a heavy
towel.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other worker is collecting, scraping
and classifying the other dishes. Before beginning
to wash, have all the dishes assorted according to
kind and size and placed convenient to hand. When
putting away remnants of food it is well to have for
the purpose a series of pitchers ranging from three
inches to about nine in height. This gives sizes suited
to any quantity which may be left over of soups, milk,
liquid vegetables, etc. They take less room than
bowls, and the graduated series ornaments the shelf.</p>

<p>A wire strainer should be kept in the sink to prevent
the larger particles of waste, indissoluble parings,
coffee grains, etc., from going down the drain. This
saves plumber's bills.</p>

<p>When ready for the washing, begin with the
glasses and wash quickly in hot water, either clear or
soapy, as preferred. Have at hand a second dish-pan
in which is placed a wire rack. Put the glasses in the
rack, rinse with hot water, and dry rapidly while still
wet and hot. It may be necessary to keep them in the
water a moment or two to get them really heated
through. In washing glass pitchers put a <i>silver</i> spoon
in them before placing in the hot water. This prevents
breakage. Treat canning-jars in the same way.</p>

<p>Next wash the silver, having the water soapy and
piping hot, in order to get a good polish. Keep spoons,
knives and forks in separate groups and all pointing
in the same direction.</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
 smaller, less greasy dishes follow the silver,
and then the heavy china. Here, again, let dishes that
have held eggs or starchy foods soak awhile in cold
or tepid water. Rinse greasy dishes well.</p>

<p>Conclude by scrubbing tables and sink with cloth,
brush, soap and sapolio as needed. Put the scrapings
in the garbage pail and pour hot water and soda down
the pipe to remove the last vestige of grease. Hang
up the shining dish-pans, after washing out the towels
and dish-cloth in soap and water, if they require it.</p>

<p>A can of Babbitt's Potash of Lye may take the
place of the washing-soda.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Bed-Making</b> (<i>Two sheets</i>, <i>blanket</i>, <i>comforter</i>, <i>cover</i>)</p>

<p>Put the lower sheet on with the right side up.
Tuck it in neatly at the corners much as one would
fold in the corners when wrapping up a box in paper.
Place the upper sheet upon this with the right side
down. This brings the two right sides together. Let
the broad hem in each case be at the head of the bed.
That of the upper sheet should just reach the head
of the mattress.</p>

<p>Place the blanket with its upper end about six
inches from the head of the bed. Then comes the
comforter, placed in the same way. Fold the sheet
down from the top just where the blanket ends. Tuck
all in neatly at the sides and the foot. Now put the
spread smoothly over all. It may be tucked in or
may hang down as desired. Place the pillows with the
closed ends of the cases together.</p>

<p>If an extra coverlet is to be placed at the foot
of the bed, fold it in thirds so that the sleeper may
reach down and draw it up over himself without rising
to the floor.</p>

<p>To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
 put on a bolster-case easily, turn it wrong side
out and then roll it up over the bolster.</p>

<p>Train children to air beds every morning by
shaking up bed-clothing and extending it over footboard
and chair.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Washing</b> (<i>Toy tub or tin basin</i>, <i>toy washboard</i>, <i>basin
for boiler</i>, <i>soap</i>, <i>bit of blueing tied in bag</i>, <i>strong
cord for line</i>)</p>

<p>Put dolls' clothes or a few dustcloths or handkerchiefs
in tub of warm water after soaping well. Let
soak awhile, then rub out on the little washboard or
between the hands, put into the boiler with cold water
and just bring to a boil. Rinse in warm water or
wash vigorously in warm water if necessary; then
rinse in warm and then in cold water; put the blueing
in a basin of cold water till the water is slightly
tinged; remove the blueing bag and rinse the clothes
in the water. (The blueing is to counteract the tendency
of white goods to grow yellow with time.)</p>

<p>Hang up to dry in the air and sunshine.</p>

<p>Tell the children that the clothes must always be
sorted, white body clothes being in one class, bed-linen
in another, table linen in another; woolens must
be washed by themselves with care to keep the water
of moderate temperature and the <i>rinsing</i> water of the
same degree of heat as the <i>washing</i> water. Flannels
must be dried as rapidly as possible. Colored garments
must be washed by themselves.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Ironing</b> (<i>Two irons</i>, <i>holders</i>, <i>ironing blanket and
sheet</i>, <i>iron-stand</i>, <i>cake of beeswax or candle</i>)</p>

<p>Before ironing the clothes must be sprinkled
lightly with cold water, smoothed out and rolled up
tightly for half an hour. Meanwhile pin the blanket
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
 the ironing board and cover smoothly with the
sheet. The iron must not be so hot as to scorch
the clothes. Try it on a piece of paper. If it seems
dirty or rough, rub it on the beeswax to make it clean
and smooth. (In place of wax a candle will serve
the purpose if wrapped around with a piece of clean
cotton cloth.) If the garment seems too wet, put a
piece of white cloth over it and iron till somewhat
dry. Then the iron may be placed directly upon the
garment.</p>

<p>Starch is prepared by wetting and dissolving it
in cold water and then pouring upon this boiling water
and boiling until clear and smooth. The young child
will not need to starch anything, however.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Sweeping</b> (<i>Broom</i>, <i>whisk-broom</i>, <i>hair-broom</i>, <i>sheet</i>,
<i>sweeping-cap</i>)</p>

<p>Let the little worker don sweeping-cap and apron,
and then proceed to dust carefully small articles and
books, place them on the bed and cover with an old
sheet. Put furniture which is movable in the hall
after dusting. Open the window. Then sweep the
rugs on both sides and place outside. Pin up the curtains.
Then dampen a newspaper and tear into small
pieces; throw these on the floor to absorb the dust.
Wet tea-leaves may be used for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Sweep, holding the broom rather closely to the
floor and taking short strokes, raising as little dust
as possible. Then leave the room for awhile, for the
dust to settle.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Dusting</b> (<i>Dusters of cheesecloth</i>, <i>clean pieces of old
silk</i>, <i>chamois-skin</i>)</p>

<p>On returning to the room after sweeping, wipe
off the baseboard, then the furniture, always working
from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
 the top down. To reach high corners where
cobwebs may lurk, pin on the brush of the broom a
cap of cheesecloth and sweep along the edges of the
ceiling. For corners under heavy furniture, a small
whisk brush or soft hair brush may be needed.</p>

<p>Rub off mirrors with a damp cloth, drying and
polishing with chamois-skin or crumpled newspaper.
Highly polished furniture may be dusted with soft
silk or chamois-skin.</p>

<p>Even small members of the family may be given
a share in this work. Little boys and girls can be
shown how to dust chairs and furniture within reach
of the little arms and hands. It may take more time
at first on the mother's part than if she did the work
herself; but in the end she is more than repaid. The
little child need not be required to do much, but let
that little be done thoroughly, if only the legs and
rounds of one chair.</p>

<br />
THE CHILD'S LIBRARY</h2>


<p>Every child should be encouraged to possess his
own books even in this age of public libraries. Birthdays
and Christmas afford occasions when the parent
can increase the little library, and later the child may
be trained how to choose wisely his own purchases.
When he is limited in the books he possesses public
libraries open up opportunities for a wide range of
reading.</p>

<p>We give a brief but varied list of books from
which the parent may select such as suit her child's
particular needs. The discriminating taste in reading
must be cultivated from the earliest years if the child
is to read with profit and pleasure in youth and maturity.</p>

<p>All children should be allowed to read a few at
least of the traditional fairy tales. They teach many
important life lessons in an impersonal way; they develop
the imagination and widen the sympathies. The
successful business man, the progressive physician or
lawyer, and the truly successful minister is he who
understands human nature, who can put himself in the
other person's place; and to do this he requires a cultivated
imagination. The fairy tale also lifts the child
from the restricted life of his environment into the
region of boundless possibilities. It increases his
sense of power over untoward circumstances. Acquaintance
with fairy lore also familiarizes one with
many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
 allusions to be met with in reading all great
writers.</p>

<p>A love of poetry should be the heritage of every
child, because of the inspiration it gives amidst the
sordid cares of life, and because of the innocent pleasure
and refreshment it affords in hours of loneliness
and weariness. The child's first book of verse should,
of course, be Mother Goose. After this there are many
valuable compilations of good poetry that may be used.</p>

<p>A varied library to be found in one large volume
is "The Children's Book" compiled by Scudder. It
includes selections from Mother Goose, from Grimm's
fairy tales, from old English fairy tales, the Arabian
Nights, and Hans Andersen. There are also several
of Maria Edgeworth's famous moral stories, a great
many of Æsop's fables, many of the old English
ballads, etc. An excellent compilation of verse is
Roger Ingpen's "One Thousand Poems for Children,"
which contains all the old favorites of children as well
as a large number of the best-known poems by standard
authors.</p>

<p>Standard books on science and nature should be
in the home, and the child's library should include a
few books with stories from real life leading up to
biography, history, and travel.</p>

<p>The little one's sense of humor must be accorded
recognition. Mother Goose supplies such a need in
part, and Lear's Book of Nonsense may be added.
The Sunday funny sheet should be censored before
being put into the hands of the child. Expurgate anything
that expresses disrespect to old age; that makes
light of honor and integrity; or that is coarse in drawing,
color, or subtle suggestion. If the child when
grown is to appreciate the delicate humor of a Charles
Lamb, his taste must not be dulled when he is young.</p>

<p>It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
 is a pity for a child to grow up without knowing
and loving the "Pilgrim's Progress." To give him
this pleasure the book should be read to him or put
into his hands when about ten years old. Otherwise
the psychologic moment has passed and he may never
learn to care for the great English classic.</p>

<p>The great mediæval legends should also be known
to the child. They are interwoven with much of
history and literature and give a glimpse into a rapidly
receding past.</p>

<p>We include in our list a charming wee volume,
"The Young Folks' Book of Etiquette," by C. S. Griffen,
which the mother, wearied of repeating from day
to day the same admonitions as to manners and morals,
will find a great assistance in seconding her efforts.
The child will enjoy both the text and the pictures.</p>

<p>For the child's Bible reading we recommend
Moulton's edition of the Old and New Testaments.
The language is identical with that of the familiar
old volume, but the text is condensed so that each story
is given in the form of a continuous narrative, and objectionable
passages are omitted. It may thus safely
be put into the hands of very young children, who enjoy
the simple, dignified style.</p>

<p>Music also must form a part of the child's library.
The list appended covers a variety of needs.</p>

KINDERGARTEN MATERIALS</h2>

<h3>The Kindergarten Gifts</h3>


<p>Friedrich Froebel, after observing and studying
thoughtfully the play and playthings of little children,
selected from among these, and arranged in logical
order, a certain series which should help develop the
little one in mind, body, and spirit through childlike
play. This series of related playthings is known as the
kindergarten "gifts."</p>

<p>All children of all races play ball, and the first
kindergarten gift to be given, even to a very little
child, consists of six soft worsted balls in the colors
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet.</p>

<p>The second gift is an oblong box containing a
wooden ball or "sphere," a cube, and a cylinder, with
several slender axles and beams to assist in the little
plays.</p>

<p>The third gift is a box containing a two-inch
cube divided horizontally and vertically into eight
one-inch cubes.</p>

<p>The fourth gift is a similar cube divided horizontally
into eight oblong blocks.</p>

<p>The fifth gift is evolved from the preceding ones
and is a five-inch cube divided into inch cubes, half
cubes, and quarter cubes.</p>

<p>The sixth gift is a cube of the same size divided
so that it contains cubes, oblongs, and plinths.</p>

<p>The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth gifts are derived
from the geometrical solids.</p>

<p>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
 seventh gift is derived from the geometrical
surfaces, and consists of wooden tablets in
shapes of circles, squares, triangles, etc.</p>

<p>The eighth gift represents the geometrical line and
is made up of wooden sticks in lengths of one, two,
three, four, five, and six inches. They may be had in
two thicknesses and either colored or uncolored.</p>

<p>The ninth gift, derived from the edge of the circle,
consists of metal rings, half rings, and quarter rings,
in several sizes.</p>

<p>The tenth gift, derived from the geometric point,
is the lentil.</p>

<p>Kindergartners differ as to the amount of emphasis
to be placed upon the geometric side of the
"gifts," and as to whether or not they should always
be presented in a certain logical order. To appreciate
their full value the mother must read her Froebel or
take a kindergarten course. We give below some
simple methods of using them, from which the child
will derive both pleasure and benefit. What follows
should be entirely clear, especially if the mother has
the "gifts" before her as she reads.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>First Gift Balls</b> (<i>Rubber ball 1&frac12; inches in diameter</i>,
<i>wool in six primary colors</i>, <i>crochet-hook</i>)</p>

<p>These balls can be made by taking a <i>rubber</i> ball
and crocheting around it a case of worsted; or a case
can be crocheted and then stuffed with loose wool or
cotton. In the latter case to insure a good shape it is
well to crochet <i>over a ball</i> till nearly finished; then
take the rubber ball out and fill with the cotton or
wool and then complete the ball. Then crochet a
string about eight inches long and attach to the ball,
for suspending it. The ball can then be swung, raised,
lowered, made to hop like a bird, swing like a pendulum,
revolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
 rapidly like a wheel. The child may
play that it is a bucket being raised or lowered. See
how steadily he can raise it.</p>

<p>The balls lend themselves to many color games.</p>

<p>1. Place them in a row, let one child blind his
eyes, another one removes one of the balls and the
first one, opening his eyes, tries to think which one is
missing.</p>

<p>2. Let children observe the colors through a glass
prism and try to arrange balls in similar order. Ask
child if he can tell which colors are uppermost in the
rainbow, the cold or the warm ones.</p>

<p>3. If the mother is sewing on a colored dress, let
the child try to pick out the ball resembling it in color.</p>

<p>4. Play hiding the ball, as in hide the thimble.</p>

<p>5. Play store, letting him tell you which ball will
best represent a lemon, an orange, a red apple, etc.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Second Gift Plays</b></p>

<p>Throughout his life, Froebel felt with keen pain
all that was discordant or inharmonious in human society.
Beneath all differences and misunderstandings
lay, he believed, the possibility of adjustment, or reconciliation.
Relations most strained might be brought
into harmonious union. This great idea is typified by
the second gift. The hard wooden sphere is <i>round,
curved from all points of view</i>, with no <i>angles</i> or
<i>edges</i>, and is <i>easily moved</i>. The cube is a complete
contrast to the sphere, inasmuch as it <i>stands firmly</i>,
has <i>flat faces</i>, <i>angles</i>, and <i>edges</i>. The cylinder combines
the characteristics and possibilities of the other
two. It has flat faces as well as a curved one, and
can both stand and roll. It forms a bond of connection
between the other two which at first sight seem
irreconcilable.</p>

<p>Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
 of these forms have small staples inserted
in side, edge, and angle so that they may be suspended,
swung, and revolved. There are also perforations
through each one admitting the insertion of the axles,
when needed for certain plays.</p>

<p>If an axle be put through cube or cylinder and it
be revolved rapidly, you can see, in the swift moving
figure, the spirit, as it were, of the other forms&mdash;an
experiment fascinating to young and old.</p>

<p>A little imagination will turn the box in which
these blocks come, into a boat, car, engine, etc., pins,
matches, tacks, wire, etc., being called in as extras.</p>

<p>The little wooden beam may be placed across, held
up by the axles and upon this the blocks may be suspended
as objects for sale in a store.</p>

<p>The box with its cover may be used to illustrate
the three primary mechanical principles, the pulley, or
wheel, the inclined plane, and the lever. The pulley
is made by placing the cylinder on an axle, tying a
little weight to one end of a cord and drawing it up
over the cylinder. Let the child play the weight is a
bucket of water being drawn up from a well.</p>

<p>Play loading a boat and use the cover for a plank,
inclined from the deck to the ground, up which to roll
a barrel (the cylinder).</p>

<p>Play that the cube is a heavy piano box and show
how to raise it by using a stick as a lever.</p>

<p>The students of a kindergarten training school
made fine derrick cranes with this box of blocks, and
no two were exactly alike.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Games with Second Gift Ball</b></p>

<p>1. Let children sit crossed-legged on the floor
in a circle and let one child roll the ball across to another
child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
 He in turn rolls it straight over to some
other child and so on.</p>

<p>2. Let one child sit in the center of a circle and
roll the ball to each child in turn, who rolls it back
to him.</p>

<p>3. Let several children stand in the center of a
ring and try to catch the ball as it rolls swiftly by.</p>

<p>4. Let children stand in center and try to avoid
being touched by the ball as it rolls along.</p>

<p>5. Draw a circle on the floor and let the children
try in turn to so roll the ball that it will stop inside of
the ring.</p>

<p>6. Place the cube in the center of the circle. Put
the cylinder on top of the cube and balance the sphere
carefully upon the cylinder. Then let the children try
to hit this target with another ball.</p>

<p>Many are the lessons in self-control, fair play,
patience and kindness which the children practice in
playing these simple games, in addition to the physical
exercise and training in alertness, in seeing correctly
and in acting quickly.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Second Gift Beads</b></p>

<p>Mrs. Hailmann, a kindergarten training teacher,
some years ago added to the "gifts" the so-called "second
gift beads," much loved by wee children.</p>

<p>These are perforated wooden beads in shape of
the sphere, cube and cylinder. They come in two sizes
and may be had in colors or uncolored. A shoe lace
comes with them for stringing.</p>

<p>In delightful plays with these beads the child
learns to distinguish form and color, and has practice
in simple designing.</p>

<p>At first let him have a number of different kinds
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
 let him thread them as he pleases. Observe him
and see if, of his own initiative, he will distinguish
either form or color. After a while he will probably,
without suggestion, begin to string them in some sort
of order&mdash;one sphere, one cube, one sphere, one cube,
etc. Two spheres, two cubes, two cylinders, etc.</p>

<p>When he begins to see differences, give him two
forms only and let him arrange. Later give him others.
Too many at first will be confusing.</p>

<p>Besides the stringing, these beads may be used
in other ways. Make a fence by putting two cubes
and a sphere, one on top of the other for a post, and
then join these to similar posts by running toothpicks
or burnt matches through the perforations.</p>

<p>Place cubes and cylinders, one on top of another,
and use as tree box with tiny twig or elderberry branch
for tree. If making a toy village of blocks or cardboard,
these little beads will make good lampposts.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>The Pegboard</b></p>

<p>The pegboard, an additional gift devised by Mrs.
Alice H. Putnam, can also be had in two sizes, the
large one to be preferred. The board is perforated
with holes at regular intervals and is accompanied
with colored pegs, which the child loves to insert in
the openings.</p>

<p>He may arrange them in ranks for soldiers, according
to color, two and two, or four and four,
learning thus to count.</p>

<p>A flower-bed with red flowers in one corner and
green bushes in another may be made.</p>

<p>He may play that the pegs are kindergarten children
playing follow the leader, some with red dresses,
some with blue waists, etc.</p>

<p>A birthday cake with candles may be represented,
or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
 a line of telegraph poles, if father has gone on a
journey, and over the imaginary wires a message may
be sent.</p>

<p>The pegboard is also loved by very young children.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Plays with the Other Gifts</b></p>

<p>The third gift cubes may be built by the little
child into houses, furniture, wagons, etc. It is very
simple, and yet when handling it the child learns
something of form and number and gains skill with
his tiny hands.</p>

<p>The fourth gift expresses "proportion." Each
block is twice the length of those in the preceding gift
and half as high. He can build with it objects impossible
with the first divided cube. The two may often
be used in conjunction.</p>

<p>The fifth gift requires a decided increase in the
child's powers of coördination. He can make with it
a very great variety of objects. Only a kindergartner
can appreciate its many possibilities.</p>

<p>The sixth gift lends itself peculiarly to buildings
of a certain type. It expresses less strength and more
grace than the preceding ones.</p>

<p>In playing with these "gifts" under direction of
a teacher, the child, if making the grocery store, proceeds
to make the counter, the scales, the money desk,
etc., in succession, and is not allowed to take the first
structure apart in disorderly fashion and then make
the next one, but is supposed to build the counter, or
other article, by gradually transforming the thing already
made, removing the blocks in ones, or twos, or
threes in an orderly way. Each block is supposed to
have some relation to the whole. For instance if a
shoe store has been made and one unused block remains,
it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
 may represent the footstool used in such a
store.</p>

<p>Froebel thought in this way through simple play
to help the child little by little to feel the relatedness
of all life.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Seventh Gift Plays</b></p>

<p>With the seventh gift tablets the child makes
designs or "beauty forms," becoming familiar with
certain geometrical forms and exercising his powers
of invention in pleasing design.</p>

<p>In using the tablets, which are in both light and
dark stains, do not give too many at first. Give him
for instance one circle, representing a picture of a
ball, and let him lay a row of such for a frieze design
for a gymnasium.</p>

<p>Give a circle and four squares, and let him place
one above, one below, one to the right and one to the
left, touching the circle. This will suggest a unit for
a tile for a playroom fireplace.</p>

<p>Tell him to change the top square so that its
angle touches the circle; then change the lower one
in the same way; then the right, then the left. This
transformation gives an entirely new design.</p>

<p>The other tablets may be employed in the same
way, the different kinds of triangles offering opportunity
for much variety.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Eighth Gift Plays</b></p>

<p>The sticks may be used in representing designs
in which the straight line prevails. The lines may be
placed in vertical or horizontal position. Sticks may
be arranged as soldiers, standing two and two in
straight vertical lines; or as fences in horizontal position.</p>

<p>They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
 may be classified as to length. Let the
child sort them as wood for the woodpile, putting together
those of same length. Or play he is in the
store to buy a cane and sees those of different lengths,
some for men, some for children.</p>

<p>For designing give the child four sticks of one
length and let him make a square. Give him four of
another length and let him make a larger square.
Then with these eight sticks let him make two oblongs
of the same size. Give him these exercises as
puzzles, but do not let him play with the sticks until
he gets nervous in trying to keep them in position.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Play With Lentils</b></p>

<p>These are necessarily few and simple. Let the
child make circles, squares, etc., by putting the lentils
in rows. He can also represent the mass of a tree's
foliage by placing a number of the lentils in a mass.</p>

KINDERGARTEN MATERIALS</h2>

<h3>The Kindergarten Occupations</h3>


<p>The kindergarten gifts proceed, as will have been
observed, from the solid through other forms to the
point. The objects made with these are but temporary,
and the same material may be used again and again.</p>

<p>Parallel with these Froebel devised what he calls
the "occupations," which put into permanent shape
the ideas expressed by the gifts.</p>

<p>Among the occupations (we will not name all)
are: Peaswork, pricking, sewing, weaving, parquetry,
pasting, cardboard modeling, sand and clay modeling.</p>

<p>These are arranged in reverse order to the gifts;
that is, they proceed from the point to the solid.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Peaswork</b> (<i>Good well-dried peas</i>, <i>wooden toothpicks
or hair-wire</i>)</p>

<p>Soak the peas for 10 or 12 hours till soft. Then
make a cane of one pea and one stick.</p>

<p>Two peas and one stick will make a dumb-bell.</p>

<p>Three of each will make a triangle.</p>

<p>Make a square in the same way, and then by
adding to this other peas and sticks a skeleton chair
can be made. All kinds of furniture and geometrical
forms may be thus manufactured. The wire or toothpick
must be inserted in the cheek of the pea. Watch
the child carefully to see that he does not get nervous
over the work. Assuming that the peas are in good
condition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
 there should be little trouble if the forms
made are simple.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Pricking</b> (<i>Thin white cardboard</i>, <i>long pin</i>, <i>several
folds of cloth or a piece of felt</i>)</p>

<p>Froebel recognized the appeal this pastime makes
to the mystery-loving child. As sometimes used it
may be injurious to nerves or eyesight; but used judiciously
the child of five or six will find it a source of
harmless entertainment.</p>

<p>Let mother or older brother draw on cardboard
a simple strong outline. Provide a strong steel pin
(hat-pin or mourning-pin will do) and a piece of
folded cloth for a cushion. Follow the outline by
pricking in it a succession of holes. The rough side
is the right side of the decorated card. The card may
be hung up as a transparency, or may be made up into
blotter or calendar; or, if the outline be that of a
vegetable or a fruit, it will make up into a Thanksgiving
place card.</p>

<p>Very beautiful effects are produced by pricking
the surface as well as the outline, a form of embossing,
but this is a great strain on the nerves. Let the child
work for only a few moments at a time, and be sure
that the light is good and the drawing is distinct.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Sewing</b> (<i>Cardboard</i>, <i>worsted</i>, <i>silk or chenille</i>, <i>needle</i>,
<i>punch</i>)</p>

<p>It is a disputed question now whether or not the
cardboard sewing of the kindergarten, once considered
so essential, should be used at all. Some condemn
it entirely; others use it sparingly. Many replace it
with sewing on cloth and other materials soft and
flexible, which lend themselves to the kind of stitching
required later in everyday sewing. We cannot
now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
 enter into the discussion, but common-sense rules
here as elsewhere.</p>

<p>Cards with designs already drawn and perforated
may be bought, but the mother need not feel that she
must depend upon these. Old visiting and invitation
cards may be used for the purpose. We give a few
examples of objects pretty and useful which may be
made of this material. These will suggest others to
the active-minded child. Get punch at kindergarten
supply store; from 50 cents up.</p>

<p>1. Gift Card. Cut a square of cardboard 5 × 5
inches. With a needleful of red worsted let the
child sew upon this card three straight candles in
stitches one inch long. You may first punch in the
bottom of the card three holes as guides. Put them
in a row equidistant from each other. Make parallel
to these a row of three dots in pencil. The child will
push the needle through one hole <i>from below</i> and put
it through the dot above, making his own hole. So
proceed till finished. A flame may be drawn with
yellow chalk at the upper end of each candle, to make
it more realistic. This card may be used to stand a
candlestick upon, or to send as a birthday card.</p>

<p>A similar card with the red stitches lying horizontally
will picture firecrackers ready to be set off.
Use as a mat for a match safe.</p>

<p>2. Cover for Medicine Glass. Draw a circle
five inches in diameter. Cut this out. Parallel
to the edge draw a circle four inches in diameter.
Make dots about &frac12; inch apart along this second circle.
Punch holes through these dots. With worsted,
ravelings or chenille let the child sew once around this
circle. Then go around the other way to fill up all
the gaps left the first time. Use as cover for glass
of medicine. Line the bottom with clean, white paper.</p>

<p>Vary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
 by overcasting, or from a central hole take
long radiating stitches to the holes in the circumference
like the spokes of a wheel.</p>

<p>3. Toy Umbrella. The above circle with spokes
may be made into a toy umbrella if a slender
stick be run through for a handle. Stick a pin about
an inch from the top to keep the umbrella part from
slipping down.</p>

<p>4. Bookmark. Cut an oblong card 2 × 6 inches.
Draw upon this a row of parallel oblique lines
about one inch apart and one inch long. Punch holes
through the ends of the lines at the bottom, sew one
slanting line to show the child, and let him finish the
row. A similar oblong will make a napkin ring if the
ends be brought together and tied with the ends of the
worsted.</p>

<p>Squares, oblongs, crosses, etc., may thus be
punched and sewed.</p>

<p>If no punch is obtainable, make the holes with a
coarse needle or strong pin.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Paper Tearing</b> (See <a href="#Page_54">page 54</a>)</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Paper Cutting</b></p>

<p>This is another Froebelian occupation. Some suggestions
have been given elsewhere. (See <a href="#Page_54">page 54</a>.)
We will speak here of a more definite series of progressive
steps.</p>

<p>Take a square of white paper. Fold once to
make an oblong. Keep folded and fold once more,
which gives a small square. From the corners of this
square cut pieces, large or small. Keep these. Open
the paper and lay it down. Then arrange around it
the cut-off corners to make a design. They may be
arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
 in a variety of ways. The pieces cut off the
corners may be of various shapes.</p>

<p>Vary another square by cutting into it, after it
has been folded, triangles or other figures. Open and
arrange around it these cut-off pieces. When a satisfactory
design has thus been made, it may be pasted
on a pleasing background of paper.</p>

<p>In kindergarten training, checked paper is provided
and the cuttings are made from lines drawn
upon this according to a progressive system.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Parquetry</b> (<i>Colored papers</i>, <i>paste</i>, <i>kindergarten slat or
match for paste-stick</i>)</p>

<p>This occupation has its parallel in the tablets.
The designs made temporarily with the circles, squares,
etc., of wood may be put into more permanent form
with the parquetry papers. These are circles, squares,
triangles, etc., of colored papers, the unit of size being
the inch. There are 1,000 in a package, embracing
the six colors&mdash;red, orange, yellow, green, blue and
violet, with two shades and two tints of each, besides
neutral tones, and black and white.</p>

<p>1. Easter Card. Give the child an oblong
piece of gray cardboard, six inches long, and some
yellow circles. Let him paste a row of circles for dandelion
heads and then chalk in the green stems. Give
to father for an Easter card.</p>

<p>Red and yellow circles may be cut in half and
so arranged as to suggest tulips. (See <a href="#Page_122">page 122</a>.)</p>

<p>2. Frieze. Let the child make designs for a
frieze for the doll-house parlor, arranging circles and
squares successively or alternately on a strip of paper.
Or he can make a design for the doll-house kitchen
oilcloth by pasting squares or circles (one square or
circle surrounded by others) in a square unit.</p>

<p>An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
 inexpensive paste for this work may be made
of gum tragacanth. Buy five cents' worth of the powdered
gum. Put a tablespoonful into an empty mucilage
bottle and fill with water. In a few moments it
will dissolve and thicken. Use more or less, according
to thickness desired.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Weaving</b> (<i>Colored kindergarten weaving mats</i>, <i>weaving
needle</i>)</p>

<p>This is one of the most popular of kindergarten
occupations.</p>

<p>Primitive man early learned to interlace the
branches of trees to make for himself a shelter, and
to weave together coarse fibres to make his crude garments.
In course of ages great skill was acquired in
thus using all kinds of flexible materials; artistic baskets
were produced of raffia and reeds, and fine garments
of linen, wool and cotton. Beautiful effects in
color and form were introduced, the designs usually
having a symbolic meaning.</p>

<p>Froebel devised, for the expression of this natural
tendency, a series of exercises with colored paper,
which gave practice in selection of color harmonies,
in designing, in counting, and which led to skill and
neatness in work.</p>

<p>Loom-weaving has been described on another
page. (<a href="#Page_90">90</a>.)  In many kindergartens it now entirely
supersedes the paper-weaving, which we will
here briefly describe.</p>

<p>1. If you do not care to buy the regular kindergarten
weaving mats, you may use smooth gray or
brown wrapping paper cut into four-inch squares. In
such a square cut <i>two</i> slits &frac12; inch apart and one inch
long. From some pretty paper cut a strip one inch
wide and two inches long and insert in the slit in the
mat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
 pasting the ends of the strip to the under side
of the mat.</p>

<p>2. Cut <i>three</i> or <i>four</i> slits in similar mats and
weave into them one-inch or half-inch strips, using
narrower ones as the child gains skill. Weave such
a strip under one and over one; then weave another,
under two and over two, etc.; thus a variety of effects
may be produced and the child meanwhile has practice
incidentally in simple counting. Such a mat may
be used to cover a glass of drinking water or medicine
glass.</p>

<p>3. A larger mat may be made of pretty paper
cut into comparatively fine slits. Paste upon this mat
a square of smooth paper as a kind of lining; fold
cornerwise and paste two edges together, making a
kind of cornucopia.</p>

<p>4. Scent-Bag. A scent-bag may be made by
putting between the mat and the lining described
above a thin piece of cotton-batting, sprinkled with
scent.</p>

<p>5. Oilcloth or Felt. Instead of paper, mats
may be woven of plain oilcloth or of felt. Have
two colors of each material, one for the mat and one
for the strips.</p>

<p>On a 5-inch square of the material draw four
parallel lines one inch apart and one inch from the
top and bottom. Then using these as guide lines, cut
four slits and weave in and out as with the paper
weaving. Ribbon may be used for the woof if desired.
Such a mat may be used for a lamp-mat or
for a flower-pot mat.</p>

<p>Among the reasons for discarding the paper-weaving
are the following: The colors are somewhat
intense, and it is not always easy to secure good harmonies;
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
 care necessary to avoid tearing the delicate
paper and soiling the delicate colors is often a
trial to highly-strung children. Therefore they should
not work at it too long at a time. A weaving needle
comes with the kindergarten weaving papers.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Paper-Folding</b></p>

<p>We give here <i>only a very few</i> of the innumerable
forms which may be made by folding paper according
to exact directions. Mother may conduct such
a little play while she is sewing and the child is on
the floor or at the table. But directions must be
exact and explicit. After once having told what to
do in quiet, distinct, clear language, do not repeat.
Train the child to hear accurately the first time.</p>

<p>Papers in many tones may be obtained from the
kindergarten supply stores, but any exact square of
white paper or of smooth brown wrapping paper
will do.</p>

<p>Place the simple open square before the child,
the edge directly in front of him. Call it a tablecloth
and ask where the different members of the
family sit. If able to wield the scissors, let him
fringe the edge all around.</p>

<p>1. Book. Give a second square and, showing
him which are the front corners, tell him to take hold
of these and fold the paper over so that the front edge
is just on a line with the back edge. Let him iron
the table cloth (crease the fold with his thumb nail)
so as to make a sharp line when opened. This makes
a little book or tent. Ask what he can read in the
book; who camps out in the tent; etc.</p>

<p>2. Window. Make another tent. Keep the tent
in front of the child and tell him to open it and
then to fold the left side over so that the left edge
exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
 meets the right edge. Crease and open, and
the result is a window with four panes. Have the
child tell what he plays he can see through it.</p>

<p>3. Tunnel. Fold a square once through the
middle as before. Open and notice the sharp line
made by the crease. Now fold the front edge to meet
exactly <i>this line</i>. Open and then fold the back edge
to meet this line. Open in such a way that the form
when standing makes a little tunnel. Roll a marble
under it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="i_173" name="i_173"></a>
<img src="images/i_173.jpg" alt="i_173" />

<p class="caption">Paper-Folding.</p>

</div>



<p>4. Barn. Fold a square into sixteen little squares
by making a tunnel in one direction and then
folding a tunnel in the other direction, so that the
creases cross each other at right angles. Open out
and cut from the <i>left edge</i> and from the <i>right edge</i>
three slits along the horizontal creases to the first
intersecting vertical crease. (See <a href="#i_173">illustration</a>.) Now
fold No. 1 over No. 2 so that one little square exactly
covers the other and paste or pin together. Do the
same at the other end. This draws the paper into
shape of gable roof. Place remaining flaps so that
one overlaps the other a trifle, as shown in the illustration.
Then cut a door in the side. (See <a href="#i_173">illustration</a>.)
This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
 can be made of a large sheet of strong
paper and will house very large paper animals.</p>

<p>5. Sailboat. Place a square of paper directly
in front of you. Fold the front edge backward to
meet exactly the back edge and crease. Open and
fold the left edge over to meet exactly the right edge
and crease. Open.</p>

<p>Turn the paper over so that <i>the under side is
uppermost</i>, and place so that a <i>corner</i> is directly in
front of you. Fold the paper so that the front corner
exactly meets the back corner and crease. Open and
fold so that the left corner exactly meets the right
corner.</p>

<p>You now have a square crossed by two diameters
and by two diagonals. Number the <i>corners</i> thus: 1, 2,
3, 4, and the <i>center</i> 0. Take the corners and hold in
one hand so that 1-0, 2-0, 3-0 and 4-0 are back to
back. Then crease in that position. The form is a
square. Lay down so that the <i>folded corner</i> faces
you. Fold the loose back corner down to meet the front
corner. Then turn over and again fold the remaining
back corner down to meet the front corner, and
two sails become visible. Fold back one-half of the
hull to make a base, and the little boat will stand and
move if breathed upon. It can be made water-tight
by dipping in melted paraffine. Melt the paraffine by
putting it in a double boiler with boiling water beneath.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Cardboard Modeling</b> (<i>Cardboard</i>, <i>knife</i>, <i>pencil</i>, <i>scissors</i>)</p>

<p>This is another of Froebel's materials which is
much used in the kindergarten. The regular kindergarten
cardboard comes in large sheets measured off
into inches, half inches and quarter inches by red and
blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
 lines. These are to assist in the accurate cutting
and folding of the stiff paper. The tinted Bristol
board obtainable at stationery stores is also much
used.</p>

<p>With this simple material older children acquire
skill of both hand and eye. The higher school grades
are now using it to a great extent in making geometrical
figures, thus gaining practice in making objects
after first making the working drawings for the same.
A tinsmith who has had kindergarten training will
find himself better equipped for his life work because
of this early experience in cutting and measuring.</p>

<p>The directions here given assume that the unruled
cardboard is used.</p>

<p>To <i>score</i> is to make a long shallow cut or scratch
in the cardboard with a knife, so that it will bend
easily. We give a few simple objects in the order of
their difficulty.</p>

<p>1. Book-Mark. Draw an oblong 1 × 8 inches.
Cut it out and punch a series of holes down the middle,
one inch apart. Run a bit of baby ribbon in and
out and thus make a simple book-mark.</p>

<p>2. Toy Wash-Bench. Draw and cut an oblong
1 × 6 inches. Draw a line straight across this one
inch from each end, and then score these lines lightly.
Bend and you have a wash-bench for doll's house.</p>

<p>3. Sugar-Scoop. Draw and cut an oblong
2 × 4 inches. Draw a line lengthwise through the
middle. Score this line, and <i>cut</i> along the score <i>one
inch from each end</i>. Score again from each end at
<i>right angles</i> to the previous crease. Bend up the
scored ends and the side, and paste the flaps together.
This may be used for the toy grocery store.</p>

<p>4. Box. Read these directions through once.
Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
 begin and work along as you read again, and
all will be clear.</p>

<p>Cut out a square measuring 4 × 4 inches. Place
squarely before you, and then on the front edge, one
inch from each side, make a dot. On the back edge,
one inch from each side, make a dot. Unite the dots
at front and back by straight lines. This gives two
vertical lines.</p>

<p>Now, on the right hand edge, one inch from
each end make a dot, and do the same on the left
hand edge. Unite these dots by straight lines, which
gives two horizontal lines crossing the ones previously
made at right angles. With a sharp knife, and ruler
to keep it straight, score along these lines so that they
may be readily bent.</p>

<p>Now, from the right edge cut along each horizontal
line a slit one inch long. From the left edge
cut along each horizontal line a slit one inch long.
These cuts will give four flaps. Bend up the four
oblong sides and fold each flap over inside the box
and paste.</p>

<p>A little experimentation on the part of older children
will show how to elongate one side so as to make
a cover.</p>

<p>Differences in the proportions of the original
piece of cardboard will make boxes of different proportions.</p>

<p>5. Work-Box. Draw a five-inch pentagon. Look
up in a geometry to find the rules for doing this.</p>

<p>Upon each side as a base erect another pentagon.
Score at the line of junction and bend the side pentagons
till the edges meet. In these edges punch holes
opposite each other, and through these tie baby ribbon
to hold them together.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Clay Modeling</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
 (<i>Potter's clay</i>, <i>oilcloth or small smooth
board</i>, <i>curtain pole</i>)</p>

<p>Clay is one of the important kindergarten materials,
and if used with care need give but little trouble.
Buy at kindergarten supply store or art shop.</p>

<p>Take a yard of table oilcloth and sew tapes to
the corners so long that the oilcloth may be tied to a
table and thus held smooth and firm. When not in
use keep rolled up on a curtain-pole, broom-handle
or dowel. This preserves it from untimely cracking.
Upon this oilcloth the child can easily work with the
clay, and the small pieces which may stick to it are
readily wiped off with a damp cloth. If preferred, a
small board about a foot square may be used instead
of oilcloth. The child soon learns not to scatter the
pieces. It is well for him to wear a little apron when
making his small works of art. When finished with
the clay, let him remove as much as possible from the
hands as a rule, what remains may be rubbed away
with a brisk clapping of the hands or is washed off
very readily.</p>

<p>1. If his first impulse is to pound and thump the
clay, show the child how pretty things may be made
by gently pressing and molding the clay between
thumb and fingers. If he is still interested in pounding,
show him how to make a sphere by rolling the
clay between the palms, and then by striking it four
times hard against the table it is transformed into a
rough sort of cube which further effort will improve.</p>

<p>2. If he inclines to make a number of balls, show
him if possible one of the cheap clay marbles, and tell
him to make some like it, though his will have no
glazing.</p>

<p>3. If you see that he is rolling the clay into long
lengths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
 suggest that he make a snake or links of a
chain.</p>

<p>4. Older children may be shown how to roll it
with the palm into long slender cylinders. Then coil
these round and round spirally upon themselves and
so build up a jar, as certain primitive races do. Then
smooth it outside and inside until well shaped.</p>

<p>5. Bowls and crude vases are easily made, and
these when dried may be painted and used to hold
matches or pencils.</p>

<p>6. Sometimes, to stir the imagination, break off
a rough piece of clay and ask the child if it looks like
anything to him. If it suggest a bird or fish or fruit,
show him how the crude form may be made more
nearly perfect.</p>

<p>7. Take a bit of clay and upon it press another
bit, and so little by little smooth and press and build
up a plaque &frac12; inch high and four inches square.
Upon this as a background, build up in the same way,
little by little, a raised leaf, or a geometrical figure,
such as a square or a Maltese cross. If a leaf is made,
copy from a real leaf.</p>

<p>When thus interested, let the older children read
Longfellow's beautiful poem, "Keramis," and the work
of the potter will have a meaning it never had before.</p>

<p>The children who thus make crude efforts to
express the beautiful gain in power little by little,
and will have added capacity to appreciate the wonderful
works of art to be seen in every gallery. They
will gain in discrimination as to what is really beautiful,
and will know how to choose those decorations
and ornaments which will make their homes truly
artistic.</p>

<p>Clay lends itself so readily to the slightest turn
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
 thought, and is so easily employed by the smallest
pair of hands, that it is one of the best materials to
give to the little child. He soon learns to tell with it
what he may be able to say in no other way.</p>

<p>When ready to put away, break into small pieces,
put the pieces together, knead a little till made into a
mass, punch a few holes in the mass, fill these with
water, put into a stone jar and cover with a damp
cloth. Or put the clay into a cloth, dampen, and then,
twisting the four corners of the cloth together, drop
the mass on the floor. Do this several times and it
will be found welded together. Then put into the
stone jar. Disinfect clay by exposing to sunshine.</p>


<p class="hang2"><b>Sand-Table</b> (<i>Kitchen table</i>, <i>saw</i>, <i>boards</i>, <i>nails</i>, <i>zinc</i>)</p>

<p>From Germany we have finally learned the value
of the sand-table and the sand-pile as means of development
to the child, not to speak of their virtues as
pure givers of joy.</p>

<p>Sand-tables may be bought at kindergarten stores,
or one may be made of a kitchen table by sawing off
the legs to the size which brings the table top within
reach of the child. Then the top should be fenced
in with boards, from three to six inches high, to keep
the sand in. It is a good plan to line the table with
zinc, since it is sometimes desirable to have the sand
pretty wet, although it generally suffices to make it
just damp enough to mold readily. It can be dampened
with a sprinkling-can.</p>

<p>1. The child will play a long while without much
suggestion. A little pail or bottle to be filled and
emptied and refilled will furnish material for his embryonic
experiments.</p>

<p>2. A tiny cast-iron spade (price one cent) will
add materially to his happiness.</p>

<p>3. Shells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
 and patty-pans of different shapes and
convolutions suggest bakery plays, and mother must
sample the baby's cookery. When houses and forts
and churches are the order of the day, paths must be
laid and bordered with stones and shells; twigs and
elderberry branches make tiny trees for tiny orchards;
and a little pan of water or a bit of mirror makes a
wee lake. The kindergarten building gifts make substantial
structures, bridges, park-benches, etc. A
winding river can be painted with blue paint on the
zinc. When the child's imagination flags, a word
from the mother or a timely story will start a new
series of plays next time.</p>

<p>4. Older children will enjoy reproducing in the
sand the hills and valleys of their environment, the
roads, woods and streams which they know, etc.</p>

<p>5. Tell of the western plant which, when uprooted
from its loose hold in the desert sand, is sent flying
by the wind over the sand, and wherever it touches
makes a perfect spiral. Let the children make such
spirals with a coiled piece of wire.</p>

<p>6. Having noticed the impression made upon the
sand by the patty-pans, the child can be led to make
designs with them by making a row of impressions
equal distances apart, arranging these in twos, in
threes, etc.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">www.gutenberg.org/license</a>.</p>

<h3>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and
the Foundation information page at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<h3>Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
